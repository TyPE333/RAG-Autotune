Future BBC2 controller Jane Root, among the company's founders, considered this a negative, puritanical and conservative view of the medium's possibilities (ref.

        "text": "The Wanderer is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter Donna Summer, released on October 20, 1980. It marks a musical departure for Summer, being an album influenced by rock and new wave whilst previous albums all fell under the disco music category. Her inaugural release of the Geffen Records label, it became a top 20 album in the United States, with the title track reaching No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100; other singles failed to enter the top ten. However, the record was less successful on the charts than her previous album Bad Girls, which topped the Billboard 200 for five weeks.\n\nThis album had been out of print, but was re-released on December 9, 2014, on the Driven by the Music label with remastered and bonus tracks, alongside all her other albums released during the 1980s (excluding She Works Hard for the Money). A reissue was released for purchasing and streaming for the 40th anniversary of the album on October 16, 2020. It features the original tracks and seven additional remix tracks.\n\nThe album sold over 600,000 copies in the United States.\n\nSummer had made her name the previous decade as the most successful female artist of the disco genre, releasing a vast selection of hit singles and albums on Casablanca Records. During this period however, Summer had felt that the label had exploited her and made her portray a sexually orientated image (\"The First Lady of Love\") with which she never felt comfortable.[citation needed] The label had also taken over other elements of Summer's personal life, to the point where she felt she had no control over her life or career.[citation needed] Having come out of a period of depression and rediscovering her Christian faith, Summer had made the decision to break away from Casablanca and file a lawsuit against them. After leaving Casablanca, Summer became the first artist to be signed to the newly established Geffen Records.\n\nBy 1980, banners reading \"disco sucks\" were seen everywhere and disco records became flops. Summer decided to leave the disco sound behind. The album was co-written and produced by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, who had produced the vast majority of Summer's hits since their partnership with her began in 1974. Production for The Wanderer was rushed; Geffen wanted to get new product out because of Casablanca's plans to release Walk Away, another greatest hits collection. \"We would have liked to do more tweaking, and have more time for production. But we just had to let it go,\" said Harold Faltermeyer about the recording of the album.\n\n\"Cold Love\" gained Summer a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Summer's rediscovered Christian faith was documented in the gospel song \"I Believe in Jesus\", for which she also received a nomination for Best Inspirational Performance. As a child Summer had sung in gospel choirs, so this song was a chance for her to go back to her roots.\n\nThe album peaked at number 13 on the Billboard album chart \u2013 selling 600,000 copies in the US \u2013 and the title track hit number 3 on the US singles chart. However, two follow-up singles \u2013 \"Cold Love\" and \"Who Do You Think You're Foolin'\" \u2013 barely reached the top 40. The album and its singles attained limited success on the UK charts. None of the singles cracked the UK top 40. Critics, however, were largely positive. Village Voice rock critic Robert Christgau wrote, \"She loves a good hook the way she loves her own child. And you can (still) dance to her.\"[2] Bil Carpenter, in his review for AllMusic, elected  \"Cold Love\" and \"Night Life\" as the best songs of the album.[1]\n\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\n"

        "title": "Valencian language",
        "text": "\n\nValencian[b] (valenci\u00e0)[c] or the Valencian language[3] (llengua valenciana)[d] is the official, historical and traditional name used in the Valencian Community to refer to the\u00a0Romance language\u00a0also known as\u00a0Catalan,[e][4][5][6][7][8] either as a whole[f] or in its Valencia-specific linguistic forms.[g][9][10] The Valencian Community's 1982 Statute of Autonomy officially recognises Valencian as the name of the native language.[3][11]\n\nValencian displays transitional features between Ibero-Romance languages and Gallo-Romance languages. According to philological studies, the varieties of this language spoken in the Valencian Community and Carche cannot be considered a single dialect restricted to these borders: the several dialects of Valencian (Alicante Valencian, Southern Valencian, Central Valencian or Apitxat, Northern Valencian or Castellon Valencian and Transitional Valencian) belong to the Western group of Catalan dialects.[12][13]\n\nThere is political controversy within the Valencian Community regarding whether it is a glottonym or an independent language. Official reports from 2014 showed that the majority of the people in the Valencian Community considered it as a separate language, different from Catalan, although the same studies show that this percentage decreases among younger generations and people with more education.[14][15] According to the 2006 Statute of Autonomy, Valencian is regulated by the Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL),[3] following the legacy established by the Castell\u00f3 Norms,[16] which adapt Catalan orthography to Valencian idiosyncrasies.\n\nSome of the most important works of Valencian literature experienced a Golden Age during the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Important works include Joanot Martorell's chivalric romance Tirant lo Blanch, and Ausi\u00e0s March's poetry. The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in the Valencian variety.[17][18] The earliest recorded chess game with modern rules for moves of the queen and bishop was in the Valencian poem Scachs d'amor (1475).\n\nThe Valencian language is usually assumed to have spread in the Kingdom of Valencia when Catalan and Aragonese colonists settled the territory after the conquests carried out by James the Conqueror.[19] A new resettlement in the 17th century, after the expulsion of the Moriscos, largely led by Castilians, defined the Spanish language varieties of inland Valencia. However, Valencian has historically been the predominant and administrative language in the kingdom.\n\nThe first documental reference to the usage of the term valenci\u00e0 to refer to the spoken language of the Valencians is found in a judicial process of Minorca against Gil de Lozano, dated between 1343 and 1346, in which it is said that the mother of the indicted, Sibila, speaks valencianesch because she was from Orihuela (formerly Oriola).[20]\n\nThe concept of Valencian language appeared in the second half of the 14th century and it was progressively consolidated at the same time that its meaning changed due to events of a diverse nature (political, social, economic).[21] In the previous centuries the Catalan spoken in the territory of the Kingdom of Valencia was called in different ways: roman\u00e7 (13th century) and catalanesch (during the 14th century, for the medieval concept of nation as a linguistic community). The concept of the Valencian language appeared with a particularistic character due to the reinforced nature of the legal entity of the Kingdom of Valencia for being the Mediterranean commercial power during the 14th and 15th centuries, becoming in the cultural and literary centre of the Crown of Aragon. Thus, the Valencians, together with the Majorcans, presented themselves to other peoples as Catalans while they referred to themselves as Valencians and Majorcans to themselves to emphasise the different legal citizenship of each kingdom.[22]\n\nIn the 15th century, the so-called Valencian Golden Age, the name \"Valencian\" was already the usual name of the predominant language of the Kingdom of Valencia, and the names of vulgar, roman\u00e7 or catalanesch had fallen into disuse. Joanot Martorell, author of the novel Tirant lo Blanch, said: \"lit.\u2009'Me atrevire expondre: no solament de lengua anglesa en portuguesa. Mas encara de portuguesa en vulgar valenciana: per \u00e7o que la nacio d\u00b7on yo so natural se\u00b7n puxa alegrar'.\" (\"I dare to express myself: not only in English in Portuguese. But even so from Portuguese to vulgar Valencian: for that the nation I am from born can rejoice\").\n\nSince the Spanish democratic transition, the autonomy or heteronomy of Valencian with respect to the rest of the Valencian-Catalan linguistic system has been the subject of debate and controversy among Valencians, usually with a political background. Although in the academic field (universities and institutions of recognised prestige) of linguists the unity of the language has never been questioned since studies of the Romance languages, part of Valencian public opinion believes and affirms that Valencian and Catalan are different languages, an idea that began to spread during the turbulent Valencian transition by sectors of the regionalist right and by the so-called blaverisme (Blaverism). There is an alternative secessionist linguistic regulation, the Normes del Puig (Norms of El Puig), drawn up by the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acad\u00e8mia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), an institution founded in 1915 by the Deputation of Valencia, but its use is very marginal.\n\nThe official status of Valencian is regulated by the Spanish Constitution and the Valencian Statute of Autonomy, together with the Law on the Use and Teaching of Valencian (ca).\n\nArticle 6 of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy sets the legal status of Valencian, establishing that:[23]\n\nPassed in 1983, the Law on the Use and Teaching of Valencian develops this framework, providing for the implementation of a bilingual educational system, regulating the use of Valencian in the public administration and judiciary system, where citizens can freely use it when acting before both, or establishing the right to be informed by media in Valencian among others.\n\nValencian is also protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, ratified by Spain. However, the Committee of Experts of the Charter has pointed out a considerable number of deficiencies in the application of the Charter by the Spanish and Valencian governments.[24]\n\nUnlike in other bilingual autonomous communities, Valencian has not historically been spoken to the same extent throughout the Valencian Community. Slightly more than a quarter of its territory, equivalent to 10-15% of the population (its inland and southernmost areas), is Spanish-speaking since the Middle Ages.\nAdditionally, it is also spoken by a small number of people in the Carche comarca, a rural area in the Region of Murcia adjoining the Valencian Community.[25][26][27] Nevertheless, Valencian does not have any official recognition in this area. Nowadays about 600 people are able to speak Valencian in Carche.[28]\n\nThe Valencian language is traditionally spoken along the coast and in some inland areas in the provinces of Alicante and Castell\u00f3n, from Vinar\u00f2s (northernmost point of the extension of Valencian on the coast of the Valencian Community) to Guardamar (southernmost point of Valencian).\n\nIn 2010 the Generalitat Valenciana, or Valencian government, published a study, Coneixement i \u00fas social del valenci\u00e0 (Knowledge and Social Use of Valencian),[29] which included a survey sampling more than 6,600 people in the provinces of Castell\u00f3n, Valencia, and Alicante. The survey simply collected the answers of respondents and did not include any testing or verification. The results were:\n\nThe survey shows that, although Valencian is still the common language in many areas in the Valencian Community, where slightly more than half of the Valencian population are able to speak it, most Valencians do not usually use Valencian in their social relations.\n\nMoreover, according to the most recent survey in 2021,[30] there is a downward trend in everyday Valencian users. The lowest numbers are in the major cities of Valencia and Alicante, where the percentage of everyday speakers is at single-digit numbers. However, the percentage of residents who claim to be able to understand and read Valencian seems to have increased since 2015.\n\nDue to a number of political and social factors, including repression, immigration and lack of formal instruction in Valencian, the number of speakers has severely decreased, and the influence of Spanish has led to the appearance of a number of barbarisms.[32]\n\nThis is a list of features of the main forms of Valencian. There is a great deal of variety within the Valencian Community, and by no means do the features below apply to every local version. For more general information about other linguistic varieties, see Catalan language.\n\nThe Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL) specifies Standard Valencian as having some specific syntax, vocabulary, verb conjugations and accent marks compared to Standard Catalan.\n\nValencian vocabulary contains words both restricted to the Valencian-speaking domain, as well as words shared with other Catalan varieties, especially with North-Western ones. Words are rarely spread evenly over the Valencian Community, but are usually contained to parts of it, or spread out into other dialectal areas. Examples include hui 'today' (found in all of Valencia except transitional dialects, in Northern dialects avui) and espill 'mirror' (shared with North-Western dialects, Central Catalan mirall). There is also variation within Valencia, such as 'corn', which is dacsa in Central and Southern Valencian, but pan\u00eds in Alicante and Northern Valencian (as well as in North-Western Catalan). Since Standard Valencian is based on the Southern dialect, words from this dialect are often used as primary forms in the standard language, despite other words traditionally being used in other Valencian dialects. Examples of this are tomaca 'tomato' (which is tomata outside of Southern Valencian) and matalaf 'mattress' (which is matalap in parts of Valencia, including the Southern Valencian area). \n\nBelow are a selection of words which differ or have different forms in Standard Valencian and Catalan. In many cases, both standards include this variation in their respective dictionaries, but differ as to what form is considered primary. In other cases, Valencian includes colloquial forms not present in the IEC standard. Primary forms in each standard are shown in bold (and may be more than one form). Words in brackets are present in the standard in question, but differ in meaning from how the cognate is used in the other standard. \n\nValencian and Catalan use the Latin script, with some added symbols and digraphs.[70] The Catalan-Valencian orthographies are systematic and largely phonologically based.[70] Standardisation of Catalan was among the topics discussed during the First International Congress of the Catalan Language, held in Barcelona October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC), founded in 1911, published the Normes ortogr\u00e0fiques in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. In 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in Castell\u00f3 de la Plana to make a formal adoption of the so-called Normes de Castell\u00f3 (Castell\u00f3 Norms), a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra's Catalan language norms.[71]\n\nThe letters k, y and w only appear in loanwords. In the case of y it also appears in the digraph ny. Most of the letters are pronounced the same in both standards (Valencian and Catalan). The letters c and g have a soft and hard pronunciation similar to English and other Romance languages, \u00e7 (found also in Portuguese and French) always has a soft pronunciation and may appear in word final position. The only differences between the main standards are the contrast of b /b/ and v /v/ (also found in Insular Catalan), the treatment of long consonants with a tendency to simplification in Valencian (see table with main digraphs and letter combinations), the affrication (/d\u0361\u0292/) of both soft g (after front vowels) and j (in most cases), the affrication (/t\u0361\u0283/) of initial and postconsonantal x (except in some cases)[ix] and the lenition (deaffrication) of tz /d\u0361z/ in most instances (especially the -itzar suffix).\n\nThe Academy of Valencian Studies (Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL), established by law in 1998 by the Valencian autonomous government and constituted in 2001, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian.[72] Currently, the majority of people who write in Valencian use this standard.[73]\n\nStandard Valencian is based on the standard of the Institute of Catalan Studies (Institut d'Estudis Catalans, IEC), used in Catalonia, with a few adaptations.[74] This standard roughly follows the Castell\u00f3 Norms (Normes de Castell\u00f3) from 1932,[75] a set of othographic guidelines regarded as a compromise between the essence and style of Pompeu Fabra's guidelines, but also allowing the use of Valencian idiosyncrasies.\n\nUntil its dissolution in November 2013, the public-service R\u00e0dio Televisi\u00f3 Valenciana (RTVV) was the main broadcaster of radio and television in Valencian language. The Generalitat Valenciana constituted it in 1984 in order to guarantee the freedom of information of the Valencian people in their own language.[76] It was reopened again in 2018 in the same location but under a different name, \u00c0 Punt, and it is owned by \u00c0 Punt Media, a group owned by the Generalitat Valenciana. The new television channel claims to be plural, informative and neutral for all of the Valencian population. It is bilingual, with a focus on the Valencian language. It is recognised as a regional TV channel.[77]\n\nPrior to its dissolution, the administration of RTVV under the People's Party (PP) had been controversial due to accusations of ideological manipulation and lack of plurality. The news broadcast was accused of giving marginal coverage of the Valencia Metro derailment in 2006 and the indictment of President de la Generalitat Francisco Camps in the G\u00fcrtel scandal in 2009.[78] Supervisors appointed by the PP were accused of sexual harassment.[79]\n\nIn face of an increasing debt due to excessive expenditure by the PP, RTVV announced in 2012 a plan to shed 70% of its labour. The plan was nullified on 5 November 2013 by the National Court after trade unions appealed against it. On that same day, the President de la Generalitat Alberto Fabra (also from PP) announced RTVV would be closed, claiming that reinstating the employees was untenable.[80] On 27 November, the legislative assembly passed the dissolution of RTVV and employees organised to take control of the broadcast, starting a campaign against the PP. Nou TV's last broadcast ended abruptly when Spanish police pulled the plug at 12:19 on 29 November 2013.[81]\n\nHaving lost all revenues from advertisements and facing high costs from the termination of hundreds of contracts, critics question whether the closure of RTVV has improved the financial situation of the Generalitat, and point out to plans to benefit private-owned media.[82] Currently, the availability of media in the Valencian language is extremely limited. All the other autonomous communities in Spain, including the monolingual ones, have public-service broadcasters, with the Valencian Community being the only exception despite being the fourth most populated.\n\nIn July 2016 a new public corporation, Valencian Media Corporation, was launched in substitution of RTVV. It manages and controls several public media in the Valencian Community, including the television channel \u00c0 Punt, which started broadcasting in June 2018.\n\nLinguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian community, the Valencian Language Academy (Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL) considers Valencian and Catalan to be two names for the same language.[83]\n\n[T]he historical patrimonial language of the Valencian people, from a philological standpoint, is the same shared by the autonomous communities of Catalonia and Balearic Islands, and Principality of Andorra. Additionally, it is the patrimonial historical language of other territories of the ancient Crown of Aragon [...] The different varieties of these territories constitute a language, that is, a \"linguistic system\" [...] From this group of varieties, Valencian has the same hierarchy and dignity as any other dialectal modality of that linguistic system [...]\nThe AVL was established in 1998 by the PP-UV government of Eduardo Zaplana. According to El Pa\u00eds, Jordi Pujol, then president of Catalonia and of the CiU, negotiated with Zaplana in 1996 to ensure the linguistic unity of Catalan in exchange for CiU support of the appointment of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar as Prime Minister of Spain.[84] Zaplana has denied this, claiming that \"[n]ever, never, was I able to negotiate that which is not negotiable, neither that which is not in the negotiating scope of a politician. That is, the unity of the language\".[j] The AVL orthography is based on the Normes de Castell\u00f3, a set of rules for writing Valencian established in 1932.\n\nA rival set of rules, called Normes del Puig, were established in 1979 by the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acad\u00e8mia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which considers itself a rival language academy to the AVL, and promotes an alternative orthography, treating Valencian as an independent language, as opposed to a variety of Catalan. Compared to Standard Valencian, this orthography excludes many words not traditionally used in the Valencian Community, and also prefers spellings such as \u27e8ch\u27e9 for /t\u0283/ and \u27e8y\u27e9 for /j/ (as in Spanish). Besides, these alternative Norms are also promoted and taught by the cultural association Lo Rat Penat.\n\nValencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (Province of Lleida and most of the Province of Tarragona).[85][86] The various forms of Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible (ranging from 90% to 95%)[87]\n\nDespite the position of the official organisations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004[15] showed that the majority (65%) of the Valencian people (both Valencian and Spanish speakers) consider Valencian different from Catalan: this position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly.[88] Furthermore, the data indicate that younger people educated in Valencian speaking areas are considerably less likely to hold these views. According to an official poll in 2014,[14] 54% of Valencians considered Valencian to be a language different from Catalan, while 41% considered the languages to be the same. By applying a binary logistic regression to the same data, it was also found that different opinions about the unity of the language are different between people with certain levels of studies and the opinion also differs between each of the Valencian provinces. The opinion agreeing on the unity of Valencian and Catalan has significant differences regarding age, level of education and province of residence, with a majority of those aged 18\u201324 (51%) and those with a higher education (58%) considering Valencian to be the same language as Catalan. This can be compared to those aged 65 and above (29%) and those with only primary education (32%), where the same view has its lowest support. People living in the province of Castell\u00f3n are more prone to be in favor of the unity of the language, while people living in the province of Alicante are more prone to be against the unity of the language, especially in the areas where Valencian is not a mandatory language at schools.[verification needed][89] Later studies also showed that the results differ significantly depending on the way the question is posed.[90]\n\nThe ambiguity regarding the term Valencian and its relation to Catalan has sometimes led to confusion and controversy. In 2004, during the drafting of the European Constitution, the regional governments of Spain where a language other than Spanish is co-official were asked to submit translations into the relevant language in question. Since different names are used in Catalonia (\"Catalan\") and in the Valencian Community (\"Valencian\"), the two regions each provided one version, which were identical to each other.[91]\n"

Built during World War I to help deliver reinforcements and supplies to German troops on the Western Front, it connected Remagen on the west bank and the village of Erpel on the east bank between two hills flanking the river.\n\nMidway through Operation Lumberjack, on 7 March 1945, the troops of the 1st U.S. Army approached Remagen and were surprised to find that the bridge was still standing.[1] Its capture, two weeks before Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's planned Operation Plunder, enabled the U.S. Army to establish a bridgehead on the eastern side of the Rhine. After the U.S. forces captured the bridge, German forces tried to destroy it many times.\n\nIt finally collapsed on 17 March 1945, 10 days after it was captured; 28 Army engineers were killed in the collapse while a further 63 were injured. Of those who died, 18 were actually missing, but presumably had drowned in the swift current of the Rhine.[2] The bridge, while it stood, and newly established pontoon bridges, enabled the U.S. Army to secure a bridgehead of six divisions, about 125,000 troops, with accompanying tanks, artillery pieces, and trucks, across the Rhine. Capturing the bridge hastened the war's conclusion,[3] and V-E Day came on May 8. After the war, the bridge was not rebuilt; the towers on the west bank were converted into a museum and the towers on the east bank are now a performing-arts space.\n\nA 2020 poll of local people found that 91% favoured rebuilding the bridge; without it there is no river crossing for 44\u00a0km (27\u00a0mi), and few ferries. In 2022 plans were initiated to build a suspension bridge for pedestrians and cyclists. Local communities indicated an interest to help fund the project and an engineer was commissioned to draw up plans.[4]\n\nRemagen is located close to and south of the city of Bonn. The town of Remagen was founded by the Romans about 2,000 years earlier. It had been destroyed multiple times and rebuilt each time. Under the Schlieffen Plan, a bridge was planned to be built there in 1912, as well as bridges in Engers and R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein.\n\nGerman General Erich Ludendorff was a key advocate for building this bridge during World War I, and it was named after him.[5] It was designed  by Karl Wiener to connect the Right Rhine Railway, the Left Rhine Railway and the Ahr Valley Railway (Ahrtalbahn)[6] and carry troops and supplies to the Western Front. Constructed between 1916 and 1919, using Russian prisoners of war as labour, it carried two railway lines and a pedestrian catwalk on either side.[5] Work on the bridge pillars and arches was done by leading construction companies Gr\u00fcn & Bilfinger[7][8] with the steel bridge built by MAN-Werk Gustavsburg.[9]\n\nIt was one of three bridges built to improve railroad traffic between Germany and France during World War I; the others were the Hindenburg Bridge at Bingen am Rhein and the Urmitz Bridge on the Neuwied\u2013Koblenz railway near Koblenz.\n\nThe railway bridge had three spans, two on either side 85 metres (279\u00a0ft) long and a central arch span of 156 metres (512\u00a0ft). It had dual tracks that could be covered with planks to allow vehicular traffic. The steel section was 325 metres (1,066\u00a0ft) long, and it had an overall length of 398 metres (1,306\u00a0ft). On the eastern bank the railway passed through Erpeler Ley, a steeply rising hill over 150 metres (490\u00a0ft) high. The tunnel was 383 metres (1,257\u00a0ft) long.[6][7] The arch at its highest measured 28.5 metres (94\u00a0ft) above the water. Its main surface was normally about 15 metres (48\u00a0ft) above the Rhine.[7]\n\nThe 4,640-tonne (5,110-short-ton) structure cost about 2.1 million marks when it was built during World War I. Since the bridge was a major military construction project, both abutments of the bridge were flanked by stone towers with fortified foundations that could shelter up to a full battalion of men.[6]  The towers were designed with fighting loopholes for troops.[5] From the flat roof of the towers troops had a good view of the valley.[7] To protect the bridge, both an engineering unit and a military police unit were assigned to the site.\n\nThe designers built cavities into the concrete piers where demolition charges could be placed.[5] During the Occupation of the Rhineland after World War I, the French filled these cavities with concrete. It was one of the four bridges that were guarded by Americans during the occupation.\n\nIn 1938, after the Germans reacquired the Rhineland and control of the bridge, they attached 60 zinc-lined boxes at key structural points to the bridge girders, each capable of containing 3.66\u00a0kg (8.1\u00a0lb) of explosives. The system was designed to detonate all 60 charges at once. The engineers connected the charges in the piers and the zinc boxes by electrical cable protected by steel pipe to a control panel inside the rail tunnel under Erpeler Ley, where engineers could safely detonate the charges.[5] As a backup, engineers laid primer cord that could be manually ignited. They believed they could destroy the bridge when necessary with minimal preparation.[5]\n\nOn 14\u201315 October 1944, an American bomb had struck a chamber containing the demolition charges of the Mulheim Bridge in Cologne, destroying the bridge. German leader Adolf Hitler reacted by demanding that demolition charges on bridges could only be set when the enemy was within a specific distance, and only exploded by written order. He ordered those \"responsible\" for the destruction of the Mulheim Bridge court-martialed. This left officers responsible for destroying bridges, in the event that the enemy approached, nervous about both blowing it too soon and the consequences if they failed.[6] In keeping with Hitler's orders, by 7 March 1945, the charges on the Ludendorff Bridge had been removed and were stored nearby.[10]\n\nIn March 1945, about 5,100 people lived in Remagen. On the western shore, the Allied bombing campaign had destroyed more than half of Erpel's buildings, including all the buildings between Erpel's marketplace and the bridge, which had been built during the 17th and 18th centuries.[7]\n\nThe Rhine near Remagen is about 300\u00a0m (980\u00a0ft) wide.[5] During Operation Lumberjack, on 7 March 1945, troops of the U.S. Army's 9th Armored Division reached the bridge during the closing weeks of World War II and were surprised to see that the railroad bridge was still standing.[1] It was one of very few bridges remaining across the Rhine, because the Germans had systematically destroyed all of the others in advance of the Allies' attack. Although the bridge was wired with demolition charges, the weak civilian-grade \"Donarite\" explosives damaged the bridge but failed to bring it down, and Allied engineers risked their lives manually removing the remaining charges before the bridge was captured.[1]\n\nThe ability to quickly establish a bridgehead on the eastern side of the Rhine and to get forces into Germany allowed the U.S. forces to envelop the German industrial area of the Ruhr.[1]:\u200a1430\u20131\u200a  Six Allied divisions crossed the damaged bridge, then it was closed for repairs, and a pontoon bridge that had been built across the river was used. The Germans sent several bombing missions to destroy the Remagen bridge; it collapsed due to cumulative damage from the unsuccessful detonation and the bombs on 17 March 1945, 10 days after it was captured.[8] The collapse killed 28 and injured 93[11] U.S. Army Engineers.\n\nThe unexpected availability of the first major crossing of the Rhine, Germany's last major natural barrier and line of defence, caused Allied high commander Dwight D. Eisenhower to alter his plans to end the war. Hitler's Nero Decree of 19 March ordered the destruction of any infrastructure that could aid the Allied advance, but the order was not carried out due to opposition from German generals and the rapid Allied advance.[1]:\u200a1432\u20134\u200a Instead, U.S. forces advanced rapidly through Germany, and by 12 April the Ninth United States Army had crossed the Elbe.[1]:\u200a1434\u200a\n\nAfter the war, the railway crossing was not deemed important enough to justify rebuilding the bridge. Parts of the land used for the approaching railway lines are now used as an industrial estate on the western bank and a park on the eastern bank.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving towers on the western bank of the Rhine have housed a museum called \"Peace Museum Bridge at Remagen\" containing the bridge's history and 'themes of war and peace'.[12] This museum was partly funded by selling rock from the two piers as paperweights, the two piers having been removed from the river in the summer of 1976 as they were an obstacle to navigation.\n\nIn the middle of 2018, the two eastern towers of the bridge were announced to be for sale. Three bids were submitted, but due to the poor condition of the building and expected costs of approximately \u20ac1.4 million for its restoration, the sale was expected to be difficult.[13]\n\nPlans were announced to rebuild a pedestrian and cycle bridge on the site of the original railway bridge in 2022.[4]\n\nIn the film It's a Wonderful Life, during the World War II montage, the narrator, Joseph, says of the character Marty Hatch, \"Marty helped capture the Remagen Bridge.\"[14]\n\nThe bridge is featured in the 1996 DOS WWII strategy game Offensive. In the Allied campaign, it needs to be captured intact; in the Axis campaign, it needs to be destroyed to slow the Allied advance.\n\nThe final three missions in the 2004 PS2 game Call of Duty: Finest Hour (\"Road to Remagen\", \"Last Bridge Standing\" and \"Into the Heartland\") are based around the battle of Remagen, the second-to-last mission specifically based around the bridge.\n\nThe final mission in the 2017 video game Call of Duty: WWII involves the player in helping take the bridge.\n\nThe Bridge at Remagen is a 1969 DeLuxe Color war film in Panavision starring George Segal, Ben Gazzara and Robert Vaughn. The film is a highly fictionalized version of actual events during the last months of World War II when the 9th Armored Division approached Remagen and captured the intact Ludendorff Bridge.\n\nThe World War II game Hell Let Loose features Ludendorff Bridge in the \"Remagen\" map where players fight for control of the bridge.[15]\n"

        "text": "Call for the Saint is a collection of two mystery novellas by Leslie Charteris, first published in the United States in 1948 by The Crime Club, and later the same year in the United Kingdom by Hodder and Stoughton. This book continues the adventures of Charteris' creation, Simon Templar, alias The Saint. \"The Masked Angel\" features the first literary appearance of Patricia Holm, Templar's on-again, off-again partner/girlfriend, since the 1940s novel The Saint in Miami.\n\nThis was the final volume in which Charteris himself used the novella format for telling his stories; the format would be revived again in the 1960s, by which time other authors were writing the stories, with Charteris usually receiving lead writer credit while acting in an editorial capacity. For the remainder of his time writing the series, Charteris would use the short story format and the next Templar book to feature novellas would be The Saint on TV, published in 1968, with featured adaptations of episodes from the 1962-68 television series based on the character.\n\nThe book consists of the following stories:\n\nThe two stories do not narratively connect with the preceding novel, The Saint Sees it Through, beyond Templar still working in the United States, and a reference to his wartime activities. Most notably, the character of Avalon Dexter, introduced in the preceding book as a new romantic (and adventure) partner for Templar, cast in the same vein as Patricia Holm, is absent without explanation, with Templar once again working with his earlier partners, Hoppy and Patricia.\n\n\"The King of the Beggars\" was adapted as an episode of the TV series The Saint which first aired on November 14, 1963 during the second season. \"The Masked Angel\" was retitled \"The Crooked Ring\" and adapted during its fourth season, first airing on July 15, 1965.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article about a mystery novel of the 1940s is a stub.

        "title": "Micrometer (device)",
        "text": "A micrometer, sometimes known as a micrometer screw gauge (MSG), is a device incorporating a calibrated screw for accurate measurement of the size of components.[1] It widely used in mechanical engineering, machining, metrology as well as most mechanical trades, along with other dimensional instruments such as dial, vernier, and digital calipers. Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of calipers (opposing ends joined by a frame). The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil. The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil.\n\nThe word micrometer is a neoclassical coinage from Greek: \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0micros, lit.\u2009'small' and Greek: \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, romanized:\u00a0metron, lit.\u2009'measure'. According to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary,[2] the word was loaned to English from French, with its first known appearance in English writing being in 1670. Neither the metre nor the micrometre (\u03bcm) nor the micrometer (device) as we know them today existed at that time. However, the people of that time did have much need for, and interest in, the ability to measure small things and small differences. The word was no doubt coined in reference to this endeavor, even if it did not refer specifically to its present-day senses.\n\nThe London Science Museum contains an exhibit \"James Watt's end measuring instrument with micrometer screw, 1776\" which the science museum claims is probably the first screw micrometer made. This instrument is intended to measure items very accurately by placing them between the two anvils and then advancing one using a fine micrometer screw until both are in contact with the object, the distance between them being precisely recorded on the two dials. However, as the science museum notes, there is a possibility that this instrument was not made c.1776 by Watt, but 1876 when it was placed in that year's Special Loan Exhibition of scientific instruments in South Kensington.[3]\n\nHenry Maudslay built a bench micrometer in the early 19th century that was jocularly nicknamed \"the Lord Chancellor\" among his staff because it was the final judge on measurement accuracy and precision in the firm's work.[4] In 1844, details of Whitworth's workshop micrometer were published.[5] This was described as having a strong frame of cast iron, the opposite ends of which were two highly finished steel cylinders, which traversed longitudinally by action of screws. The ends of the cylinders where they met was of hemispherical shape. One screw was fitted with a wheel graduated to measure to the ten thousandth of an inch. His object was to furnish ordinary mechanics with an instrument which, while it afforded very accurate indications, was yet not very liable to be deranged by the rough handling of the workshop.\n\nThe first documented development of handheld micrometer-screw calipers was by Jean Laurent Palmer of Paris in 1848;[6] the device is therefore often called palmer in French, tornillo de Palmer (\"Palmer screw\") in Spanish, and calibro Palmer (\"Palmer caliper\") in Italian. (Those languages also use the micrometer cognates: microm\u00e8tre, micr\u00f3metro, micrometro.) The micrometer caliper was introduced to the mass market in anglophone countries by Brown & Sharpe in 1867,[7] allowing the penetration of the instrument's use into the average machine shop. Brown & Sharpe were inspired by several earlier devices, one of them being Palmer's design. In 1888, Edward W. Morley added to the precision of micrometric measurements and proved their accuracy in a complex series of experiments.\n\nThe culture of toolroom accuracy and precision, which started with interchangeability pioneers including Gribeauval, Tousard, North, Hall, Whitney, and Colt, and continued through leaders such as Maudslay, Palmer, Whitworth, Brown, Sharpe, Pratt, Whitney, Leland, Johansson, and others, grew during the Machine Age to become an important part of combining applied science with technology. Beginning in the early 20th century, one could no longer truly master tool and die making, machine tool building, or engineering without some knowledge of the science of metrology, as well as the sciences of chemistry and physics (for metallurgy, kinematics/dynamics, and quality).\n\nEach type of micrometer caliper can be fitted with specialized anvils and spindle tips for particular measuring tasks. For example, the anvil may be shaped in the form of a segment of screw thread, in the form of a v-block, or in the form of a large disc.\n\nMicrometers use the screw to transform small distances[8] (that are too small to measure directly) into large rotations of the screw that are big enough to read from a scale. The accuracy of a micrometer derives from the accuracy of the thread-forms that are central to the core of its design. In some cases it is a differential screw. The basic operating principles of a micrometer are as follows:\n\nFor example, if the lead of a screw is 1\u00a0mm, but the major diameter (here, outer diameter) is 10\u00a0mm, then the circumference of the screw is 10\u03c0, or about 31.4\u00a0mm. Therefore, an axial movement of 1\u00a0mm is amplified (magnified) to a circumferential movement of 31.4\u00a0mm. This amplification allows a small difference in the sizes of two similar measured objects to correlate to a larger difference in the position of a micrometer's thimble. In some micrometers, even greater accuracy is obtained by using a differential screw adjuster to move the thimble in much smaller increments than a single thread would allow.[9][10][11]\n\nIn classic-style analog micrometers, the position of the thimble is read directly from scale markings on the thimble and sleeve (for names of parts see next section). A vernier scale is often included, which allows the position to be read to a fraction of the smallest scale mark. In digital micrometers, an electronic readout displays the length digitally on an LCD on the instrument. There also exist mechanical-digit versions, like the style of car odometers where the numbers \"roll over\".\n\nA micrometer is composed of:\n\nMicrometers are high precision instruments. Proper use of them requires not only understanding their operation itself but also the nature of the object and the dynamic between the instrument and the object as it is being measured. For simplicity's sake, in the figures and text below issues related to deformation or definition of the length being measured are assumed to be negligible unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe spindle of a micrometer graduated for the Imperial and US customary measurement systems has 40 threads per inch, so that one turn moves the spindle axially 0.025\u00a0inch (1 \u00f7 40 = 0.025), equal to the distance between adjacent graduations on the sleeve. The 25 graduations on the thimble allow the 0.025\u00a0inch to be further divided, so that turning the thimble through one division moves the spindle axially 0.001\u00a0inch (0.025 \u00f7 25 = 0.001). Thus, the reading is given by the number of whole divisions that are visible on the scale of the sleeve, multiplied by 25 (the number of thousandths of an inch that each division represents), plus the number of that division on the thimble which coincides with the axial zero line on the sleeve. The result will be the diameter expressed in thousandths of an inch. As the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., appear below every fourth sub-division on the sleeve, indicating hundreds of thousandths, the reading can easily be taken.\n\nSuppose the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 2, and three additional sub-divisions, were visible on the sleeve (as shown in the image), and that graduation 1 on the thimble coincided with the axial line on the sleeve. The reading would then be 0.2000 + 0.075 + 0.001, or 0.276\u00a0inch.\n\nThe spindle of an ordinary metric micrometer has 2 threads per millimetre, and thus one complete revolution moves the spindle through a distance of 0.5 millimetres. The longitudinal line on the sleeve is graduated with 1 millimetre divisions and 0.5 millimetre subdivisions. The thimble has 50 graduations, each being 0.01 millimetre (one-hundredth of a millimetre). Thus, the reading is given by the number of millimetre divisions visible on the scale of the sleeve plus the division on the thimble which coincides with the axial line on the sleeve.\n\nAs shown in the image, suppose that the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 5, and one additional 0.5 subdivision were visible on the sleeve. The reading from the axial line on the sleeve almost reaches graduation 28 on the thimble. The best estimate is 27.9 graduations. The reading then would be 5.00 (exact) + 0.5 (exact) + 0.279 (estimate) = 5.779\u00a0mm (estimate). As the last digit is an \"estimated tenth\", both 5.780\u00a0mm and 5.778\u00a0mm are also reasonably acceptable readings but the former cannot be written as 5.78\u00a0mm or, by the rules for significant figures, it is then taken to express ten times less precision than the instrument actually has! But note that the nature of the object being measured often requires one should round the result to fewer significant figures than which the instrument is capable.\n\nSome micrometers are provided with a vernier scale on the sleeve in addition to the regular graduations. These permit measurements within 0.001\u00a0millimetre to be made on metric micrometers, or 0.0001\u00a0inches on inch-system micrometers.\n\nThe additional digit of these micrometers is obtained by finding the line on the sleeve vernier scale which exactly coincides with one on the thimble. The number of this coinciding vernier line represents the additional digit.\n\nThus, the reading for metric micrometers of this type is the number of whole millimeters (if any)  and the number of hundredths of a millimeter, as with an ordinary micrometer, and the number of thousandths of a millimeter given by the coinciding vernier line on the sleeve vernier scale.\n\nFor example, a measurement of 5.783\u00a0millimetres would be obtained by reading 5.5\u00a0millimetres on the sleeve, and then adding 0.28\u00a0millimetre as determined by the thimble. The vernier would then be used to read the 0.003 (as shown in the image).\n\nInch micrometers are read in a similar fashion.\n\nNote: 0.01 millimeter = 0.000393\u00a0inch, and 0.002\u00a0millimeter = 0.000078\u00a0inch (78 millionths) or alternatively, 0.0001\u00a0inch = 0.00254\u00a0millimeters. Therefore, metric micrometers provide smaller measuring increments than comparable inch unit micrometers\u2014the smallest graduation of an ordinary inch reading micrometer is 0.001\u00a0inch; the vernier type has graduations down to 0.0001\u00a0inch (0.00254\u00a0mm). When using either a metric or inch micrometer, without a vernier, smaller readings than those graduated may of course be obtained by visual interpolation between graduations.\n\nOn most micrometers, a small pin spanner is used to turn the sleeve relative to the barrel, so that its zero line is repositioned relative to the markings on the thimble. There is usually a small hole in the sleeve to accept the spanner's pin. This calibration procedure will cancel a zero error: the problem that the micrometer reads nonzero when its jaws are closed.\n\nA standard one-inch micrometer has readout divisions of 0.001\u00a0inch and a rated accuracy of \u00b10.0001\u00a0inch[14] (\"one tenth\", in machinist parlance). \nBoth the measuring instrument and the object being measured should be at room temperature for an accurate measurement; dirt, operator skill issue, and misuse (or abuse) of the instrument are the main sources of error.[15]\n\nThe accuracy of micrometers is checked by using them to measure gauge blocks,[16] rods, or similar standards whose lengths are precisely and accurately known. If the gauge block is known to be 0.75000\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00005\u00a0inch (\"seven-fifty plus or minus fifty millionths\", that is, \"seven hundred fifty thou plus or minus half a tenth\"), then the micrometer should measure it as 0.7500\u00a0inch. If the micrometer measures 0.7503\u00a0inch, then it is out of calibration. Cleanliness and low (but consistent) torque are especially important when calibrating\u2014each tenth (that is, ten-thousandth of an inch), or hundredth of a millimetre, \"counts\"; each is important. A mere speck of dirt, or a mere bit too much squeeze, obscures the truth of whether the instrument can read correctly. The solution is simply conscientiousness\u2014cleaning, patience, due care and attention, and repeated measurements (good repeatability assures the calibrator that their technique is working correctly).\n\nCalibration typically checks the error at 3 to 5 points along the range. Only one can be adjusted to zero. If the micrometer is in good condition, then they are all so near to zero that the instrument seems to read essentially \"-on\" all along its range; no noticeable error is seen at any locale. In contrast, on a worn-out micrometer (or one that was poorly made to begin with), one can \"chase the error up and down the range\", that is, move it up or down to any of various locales along the range, by adjusting the sleeve, but one cannot eliminate it from all locales at once.\n\nCalibration can also include the condition of the tips (flat and parallel), ratchet, and linearity of the scale.[17] Flatness and parallelism are typically measured with a gauge called an optical flat, a disc of glass or plastic ground with extreme accuracy to have flat, parallel faces, which allows light bands to be counted when the micrometer's anvil and spindle are against it, revealing their amount of geometric inaccuracy.\n\nCommercial machine shops, especially those that do certain categories of work (military or commercial aerospace, nuclear power industry, medical, and others), are required by various standards organizations (such as ISO, ANSI, ASME,[18] ASTM, SAE, AIA, the U.S. military, and others) to calibrate micrometers and other gauges on a schedule (often annually), to affix a label to each gauge that gives it an ID number and a calibration expiration date, to keep a record of all the gauges by ID number, and to specify in inspection reports which gauge was used for a particular measurement.\n\nNot all calibration is an affair for metrology labs. A micrometer can be calibrated on-site anytime, at least in the most basic and important way (if not comprehensively), by measuring a high-grade gauge block and adjusting to match. Even gauges that are calibrated annually and within their expiration timeframe should be checked this way every month or two if they are used daily. They usually will check out OK as needing no adjustment.\n\nThe accuracy of the gauge blocks themselves is traceable through a chain of comparisons back to a master standard such as the international prototype of the meter. This bar of metal, like the international prototype of the kilogram, is maintained under controlled conditions at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures headquarters in France, which is one of the principal measurement standards laboratories of the world. These master standards have extreme-accuracy regional copies (kept in the national laboratories of various countries, such as NIST), and metrological equipment makes the chain of comparisons. Because the definition of the meter is now based on a light wavelength, the international prototype of the meter is not quite as indispensable as it once was. But such master gauges are still important for calibrating and certifying metrological equipment. Equipment described as \"NIST traceable\" means that its comparison against master gauges, and their comparison against others, can be traced back through a chain of documentation to equipment in the NIST labs. Maintaining this degree of traceability requires some expense, which is why NIST-traceable equipment is more expensive than non-NIST-traceable. But applications needing the highest degree of quality control mandate the cost.\n\nA micrometer that has been zeroed and tested and found to be off might be restored to accuracy by further adjustment. If the error originates from the parts of the micrometer being worn out of shape and size, then restoration of accuracy by this means is not possible; rather, repair (grinding, lapping, or replacing of parts) is required. For standard kinds of instruments, in practice it is easier and faster, and often no more expensive, to buy a new one rather than pursue refurbishment.\n"

        "text": "Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist (8 August 1881 \u2013 13 November 1954) was a German Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) of the Wehrmacht during World War II. Born into the Prussian noble family von Kleist, Kleist entered the Prussian Army in 1900 and commanded a cavalry squadron during World War I. Kleist joined the Reichswehr of inter-war Germany before being discharged in 1938.\n\nRecalled to active duty at the beginning of World War II, Kleist commanded a motorised corps in the Invasion of Poland. He then became the commander of Panzer Group Kleist (later 1st Panzer Army), the first operational formation of several Panzer corps in the Wehrmacht during the Battle of France, the Battle of Belgium, the Invasion of Yugoslavia and Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring the Battle of France, units under Kleist's command included Heinz Guderian's armoured corps and spearheaded the \"blitzkrieg\" attack through the Ardennes forest, outflanking the Maginot Line. His  panzer divisions eventually pushed deep into France, resulting in Allied defeat. He then commanded the 1st Panzer Army as it drove deep into Ukraine and the Caucasus during Operation Barbarossa.\n\nKleist was appointed commander-in-chief of Army Group A during the last days of Case Blue, the 1942 German summer offensive in southern Russia. His disagreements with Hitler over strategic decisions led to his dismissal in March 1944 after the German defeat in right-bank Ukraine.\n\nFollowing the war, Kleist was extradited to the Soviet Union where he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for war crimes; he died in prison.\n\nPaul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist was born in Braunfels into the House of Kleist, an old Pomeranian noble family with a long history of military service. There had been two previous Prussian field marshals, numerous generals and Pour le M\u00e9rite recipients in the family. He was the son of Geheimer Studienrat Christof Hugo Albrecht August von Kleist (1848-1886), a high-ranking civil servant, and his wife, Elisabeth Gley (b. 1856).[1]\n\nAt the age of 18, Kleist joined the Prussian field artillery regiment, \"General Feldzeugmeister\" No. 3 on 9 March 1900 as a fahnenjunker. He was commissioned as a leutnant on 18 August 1901. He became a battalion adjutant in 1904 and regimental adjutant in 1907. After attending the cavalry school at Hanover from 1908 to 1909, he was promoted to oberleutnant in 1910 and was sent to the prestigious War Academy in Berlin, to undergo general staff training. On 22 March 1914 he was promoted to captain and joined the 1st Life Hussars Regiment (Leib-Husaren-Regiment No. 1).[2]\n\nDuring the First World War, Kleist served on the Eastern Front and commanded a cavalry squadron at the Battle of Tannenberg. From 1915 to 1918 he served as a staff officer of the Guards Cavalry Division on the Western Front.\n\nAfter the First World War ended, Kleist joined the Freikorps and participated in the Latvian and Estonian Wars of Independence as a member of the Iron Division. In June 1919, he led an attack group during the Battle of C\u0113sis.[3]\n\nKleist joined the Reichswehr in 1920. From 1924 to 1928, he was assigned as a tactics instructor at the Hannover Cavalry School. In 1928, he served as the chief of staff of the 2nd Cavalry Division in Breslau, then from 1929 to 1931, he held the same position in the 3rd Division in Berlin. Kleist was promoted to Colonel in 1931 and was given command of the 9th (Prussian) Infantry Regiment in Potsdam. At the beginning of 1932, he was given command of the 2nd Cavalry Division. In October 1932, he was promoted to Major General.[4]\n\nKleist was a monarchist, and did not heavily involve himself in the politics of the Weimar Republic. He openly favored the restoration of the House of Hohenzollern.[5][6] After the Nazis seized power, the Reichswehr was united with the newly formed Wehrmacht. On 1 December 1933, he was promoted to lieutenant general. In October 1934, he was given command of the \"Breslau Army\", which was later reorganized into the VIII. Army Corps. In 1935, he was given command of the newly formed military district VIII responsible for Silesia while simultaneously serving as the commanding general of the VIII. Army Corps. On 1 August 1936, he was promoted to General of the Cavalry.\n\nKleist was a member of the Order of Saint John, an ancient Protestant religious order. In 1935, Prince Oskar of Prussia, the Order's Grand Master, made him a Knight of Justice of the Order.[6]\n\nAfter the war, Kleist claimed that being forced to listen to the proclamation of the antisemitic Nuremberg Laws was a \"great humiliation\" of his life.[7] On February 5, 1938, during the Blomberg\u2013Fritsch affair when Hitler purged the army of staff who were unsympathetic to the Nazi regime, Kleist was forced to retire from service for his monarchist attitudes. Despite his forced retirement, Kleist received a significant departing honor when he was authorized to wear the uniform of the 8th Cavalry Regiment.[5] According to Kleist, he withdrew from the army because he spoke out too loudly in favor of Christianity and the church, which clashed with Nazi ideology.[8][9] To secure his retirement, he acquired a property near Breslau.[10]\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Kleist was recalled to active duty and led the XXII Motorised Corps in the Invasion of Poland. Kurt Zeitzler, the future chief of the Army General Staff, served as his chief of staff. His corps broke through the southern wing of the Polish army. According to Kleist, during the campaign, he successfully utilized cavalry tactics with his motorized units. Kleist's units also encountered friendly Soviet units invading Poland from the east; his first impression of them was positive. He particularly noted their surprising extent of motorization, good behavior and advanced military technique.[11]\n\nIn May 1940, Panzer Group Kleist was formed, the first operational formation of several Panzer corps in the Wehrmacht. Zeitzler continued to serve as Kleist's Chief of Staff. Panzer Group Kleist, consisting of XIV Corps under Wietersheim, XLI Panzer Corps under Reinhardt, and XIX Panzer Corps under Heinz Guderian, played a pivotal role in the Invasion of Belgium, France and the Low Countries. On 10 May, it spearheaded the German breakthrough in the Ardennes. As it advanced through southern Belgium, Kleist and Guderian clashed over where the main point of effort should fall. Kleist, Guderian's immediate superior, pressed for the main point to come at Flize, further west than Sedan. Kleist argued that the blow would avoid a double river crossing at the Meuse (at Sedan) and Ardennes canal (to the west of Sedan). Moreover, the blow would strike at the dividing line between the French Ninth Army and the French Second Army. Guderian saw things differently, and pointed out that a thrust along the lines of Kleist's plan would put the flank of the advance within range of the fortress artillery at Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, some 25 kilometres (16\u00a0mi) northwest of Sedan. The shift of operations further north would also disperse concentration (or Schwerpunkt) and disrupt the intense planning of the German tactical units, who had been in training for the Sedan attack and an advance north-west, for months. He also felt that a regrouping period in front of Sedan would delay the assault for 24 hours and allow the French to bring up reinforcements. Kleist agreed that such a delay was unacceptable, so he agreed to Guderian's plan.[12] Panzer Group Kleist overwhelmed the French defenses at Sedan, advanced west and reached the sea, forming a huge pocket containing several Belgian, British, and French armies.[13] Kleist said of his role in the French campaign after the war:[14]\n\nWithout being unduly modest I can assert that I was the most active army commander in France and that I shortened the French campaign by many months by my panzer actions.\nKleist was promoted to Generaloberst on 19 July 1940 and received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. In April 1941, Panzer Group Kleist was renamed to 1st Panzer Group, and spearheaded the invasion of Yugoslavia. Deployed against central Yugoslavia (Serbia), units of the 1st Panzer Group were the first to enter Belgrade.[15]\n\nIn June 1941, with the launching of Operation Barbarossa, Kleist led the 1st Panzer Group as part of Army Group South\u00a0\u2013 tasked with the capture of Moldavia and Ukraine\u00a0\u2013 and saw success in the initial phase of the invasion, advancing deep into Ukraine. The 1st Panzer Group broke through the Stalin Line, then defeated the five mechanized corps of the Soviet 5th Army and 6th Army in the Battle of Brody (23 to 30 June 1941). In July 1941, during the Battle of Uman, the 1st Panzer Group broke through the Soviet Southern Front's lines, leading to the encirclement and annihilation of the Soviet 6th and 12th armies to the southeast of Uman city (in present-day Cherkasy Oblast). During the First Battle of Kiev of August\u2013September 1941, 1st Panzer Group's northward turn from central Ukraine in conjunction with 2nd Panzer Group's southward advance from Smolensk led to the encirclement and destruction of the entire Soviet Southwestern Front east of Kiev, inflicting over 600,000 losses on the Red Army. However, the campaign had been costly, leaving the German forces with just half the tanks they had had three months earlier.\n\nKleist was very favorably impressed by the Red Army. He remarked after the war: \"The men were first-rate fighters from the start, and we owed our success simply to superior training. They became first-rate soldiers with experience. They fought most toughly, had amazing endurance, and could carry on without most of the things other armies regarded as necessities. The Staff were quick to learn from their early defeats, and soon became highly efficient.\"[16] On Soviet technical innovation and arms, he noted: \"Their equipment was very good even in 1941, especially the tanks. Their artillery was excellent, and also most of the infantry weapons \u2013 their rifles (SVT-40) were more modern than ours, and had a more rapid rate of fire. Their T-34 was the finest in the world.\"[17]\n\nAfter operations at Kiev concluded, Kleist's 1st Panzer Army advanced east to capture the important industrial Donbas region. On 26 September 1941, the Battle of the Sea of Azov began as the Southern Front  launched an attack on the northern shores of the Sea of Azov against the German 11th Army advancing into the Crimea. On 1 October, the 1st Panzer Army swept south and encircled the two attacking Soviet 9th and 18th armies at Melitopol (Zaporizhzhia Oblast); by 11 October, both Soviet armies had been destroyed and the 1st Panzer Army had taken the Donbas.[18] The 1st Panzer Army then attacked east along the shore of the Sea of Azov toward Rostov near the mouth of the Don river, the last barrier before the Caucasus.\n\nOn 17 November 1941, the German forces forced their way across the Mius River and launched an offensive against the Southern Front at Rostov. On 19 November 1941, the 1st Panzer Army reached Rostov and the following day, they seized bridges over the river Don. Three days after reaching Rostov, the 1st Panzer Army had captured the city.[19] However, on 27 November, the Southern Front, as part of the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation, counter-attacked the 1st Panzer Army's over-extended spearhead from the north, forcing them to pull out of Rostov. By 2 December 1941, the Soviet forces had retaken Rostov and forced the 1st Panzer Army to withdraw back to the Mius River, near Taganrog.[19] This marked the first major German withdrawal of the war. On 18 February 1942, Kleist was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross.\n\nIn 1942, Kleist was given an estate worth 567,000 Reichsmarks by the Nazi regime.[20] A Silesian estate already owned by Kleist was extended by 100-hectares; this particular extension concerned a confiscated Jewish-owned tract that was being divided up.[21] This was a part of Hitler's policy of buying the loyalty of his senior commanders.\n\nDuring the Second Battle of Kharkov on 17 May 1942 as part of Operation Fredericus, Kleist's 1st Panzer Army attacked the Barvenkovo bridgehead from the south, advancing up to ten kilometres in the first day of the attack. On 19 May, the German 6th Army led by General Friedrich Paulus launched an offensive north of the bridgehead, encircling the Soviet 6th Army and 57th Army.[22] After six days of encirclement, both armies were destroyed. By 28 May Kleist and Paulus' armies had captured 240,000 prisoners and destroyed or captured over 1250 Soviet tanks and 2000 artillery pieces.[22]\n\nThe summer of 1942 saw Army Group South subdivided into Army Group A and B. Army Group A, which included Kleist's 1st Panzer Army, had the task of leading the Axis thrust into the Caucasus in the execution of Case Blue, the German offensive which aimed to capture the important oilfields of Grozny and Baku.[23] The 1st Panzer Army was to spearhead the attack. Army Group A advanced deep into Southern Russia, capturing Rostov-on-Don, the oil city of Maykop, Krasnodar and the Kuban region. However, heavy Soviet resistance and the long distances from Axis sources of supply eventually reduced the Axis offensive to local advances only, and prevented Army Group A from capturing their ultimate objectives.[24]\n\nOn 22 November 1942, Kleist replaced Field Marshal Wilhelm List as commander of Army Group A near the end of Case Blue. Hitler ordered him to hold position and to resume the offensive should the Axis forces take Stalingrad. This possibility ended after the Soviets launched counter-offensives Operation Uranus (November 1942), which encircled the German 6th Army in Stalingrad, and Operation Little Saturn (December 1942 to February 1943). Little Saturn aimed to cut off Army Group A in the Caucasus, however, the limited scope of the Soviet offensive gave Kleist enough time to withdraw his Army Group A in the direction of the Kuban, abandoning the Caucasus.[15][25] Kleist later said after the war:[26]\n\nThe capture of Stalingrad was subsidiary to the main aim. It was only of importance as a convenient place, in the bottleneck between Don and the Volga, where we could block an attack on our flank by Russian forces coming from the east. At the start, Stalingrad was no more than a name on the map to us.\nKleist also said that he tried to persuade Hitler against using Romanian, Hungarian and Italian troops to cover the advancing German armies' long exposed flank. However, Hitler did not listen. Hitler told Kleist that these troops \"would only be used to hold the flank along the Don river from Voronezh to its southerly bend, and beyond Stalingrad to the Caspian,\" which, according to Hitler, were the \"easiest sectors to hold.\"[27]\n\nOn 1 February 1943, Kleist was promoted to Field Marshal. In July 1943, the Red Army launched a massive offensive along the Dnieper river. By October 1943, the 17th Army, a part of Army Group A, was forced to retreat from the Kuban bridgehead across the Kerch Strait to Crimea. Erwin Jaenecke, commander of the 17th Army, declared that he refused to take the responsibility for another Stalingrad, and proposed to execute a command to evacuate, which Army Group A had issued on the 26th and Hitler had canceled. Kleist countered with an order to hold the Crimea no matter how the battle went. Kleist, who personally opposed Hitler on the question of holding the Crimea,[28] called Jaenecke on the 28th and said to him: \"As a soldier I have often had to struggle with myself in similar situations. You will not save a single man. What is to come will come one way or another. This attitude only undermines the confidence of the troops...\"[29]\n\nIn November 1943, the Soviets eventually cut off the land-based connection of 17th Army through the Perekop Isthmus. By December 1943, the Soviets had conquered the west bank of the Dnieper, and Kleist's Army Group A was forced to retreat to southwest Ukraine. In December 1943, the Soviets launched the Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive against Erich von Manstein's re-constituted Army Group South, intending to capture all of the Ukrainian and Moldavian territories under the Axis forces. As part of the initial phase of the offensive, the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front to the south launched the Nikopol\u2013Krivoi Rog Offensive against Kleist's Army Group A. Proceeding slowly at first, the front eventually destroyed the salient projecting around Kryvyi Rih and Nikopol, costing the Germans the important mining operations there as well as nearly encircling the reformed German 6th Army.[30] On 11 March, Kleist declared that Army Group A would retreat into Bessarabia \"in spite of the F\u00fchrer and in spite of Antonescu.\"[31] By the end of March 1944, the German Dnieper line was broken and the Soviets had recovered most of right-bank Ukraine. This defeat, along with other Soviet offensive, resulted in heavy German casualties. German losses, while less than Soviet losses, were much more difficult to sustain, as there were no further reserves of men and materiel to draw on.[32] Kleist had disagreed with Hitler over the withdrawal of Army Group A during the offensive. He had demanded permission to pull back his forces to more defensible positions, however, Hitler ordered his armies to stand where they were.[33] Hitler blamed his generals for the overall strategic success of Soviet armies, and on 30 March 1944, Kleist was dismissed and replaced by Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner.[25]\n\nAfter the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler failed (1944), the Gestapo implicated and arrested Kleist due to the involvement of his cousin Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin in the Oster conspiracy. Kleist avoided trial and was later released.\n\nHistorian Samuel W. Mitcham writes that Kleist had tried to \"win over\" the local population of the Caucasus and Ukraine.[34] In September 1942, Kleist remarked: \"these vast spaces depress me. And these vast hordes of people! We\u2019re lost if we don\u2019t win them over.\"[35] He appointed two former military attach\u00e9s to Moscow to his staff, Ernst August K\u00f6string and Oskar von Niedermayer, who advised Kleist on the treatment of non-Russian ethnic minorities.[34] Neidermeyer had also been a professor of geopolitics at the University of Berlin. Partly as a result of Kleist's policies, around 800,000 Soviet citizens were recruited as collaborators in the fight against the Soviet Union.[34] These men included minorities such as Azerbaijanis, Uzbeks, Georgians, and Cossacks, many of whom would serve in Ostlegionen and Russian Liberation Army units. Kleist employed these recruits in Cossack cavalry regiments under his command, which would lead to the creation of the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division. He also commanded the 162nd Infantry Division, which drew from Ostlegion recruits.[34]\n\nAccording to Mitcham and Boris Khavkin, a professor of history at the Russian State University for the Humanities, Kleist's more \"humane\" policies led to clashes with Fritz Sauckel, General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment (head of slave labor importation for Nazi Germany), and Erich Koch, Reichskommissar of Ukraine.[34][9] Mitcham writes that Kleist once ordered subordinates to make sure that 'voluntary' labor recruitment programs in his area were actually voluntary, which enraged Sauckel and Koch. Kleist also once summoned SS, Gestapo and 'Police' officials to his headquarters and told them that he would not allow \"excesses\" in his zone of command.[34]\n\nAccording to Khavkin, on December 6, 1942, Kleist abolished the mandatory wearing of the Star of David in the Nalchik Ghetto.[9] When he was told to destroy the Mountain Jews, Kleist asked for a reexamination of them by the Office of Racial Policy.[9] Under Kleist's supervision, the Mountain Jews of Nalchik established a council which succeeded in convincing the Germans that they were not Jewish, but part of the indigenous population of the Caucasus.[9][36] As a result of this, the Nazis focused on the killing of Ashkenazi Jews in Nalchik, between 600 and 1,000 of whom were murdered between November and December 1942 in his area of command.[36] The majority of the Mountain Jews however, survived when Nalchik was liberated by Soviet troops on January 4, 1943.[9] Between 1941 and 1944, thousands of Jews were massacred in Bessarabia, mostly by Romanian forces.[37] Although in early 1944, Bessarabia and its capital Kishinev (Chi\u0219in\u0103u) was an area occupied by some units under his command, he claimed that he thought the Romanian forces had committed such massacres alone.[38]\n\nAfter his capture by the Americans, Kleist admitted to psychologist Leon Goldensohn that in the winter of 1941 to 1942 he was aware of rumors that Jews were being deported in order to be assembled somewhere, he was also aware of antisemitic actions such as the Lviv pogroms.[39] However, according to him, he did not believe rumors of atrocities committed by German forces on the Eastern Front, as he was reassured that they were just rumors or that \"non-Germans had done these beastly things\".[7][38] He claimed that in January 1943, after he heard that Jews were to be murdered in his territory, he called for SS police chief Gerret Korsemann and told him that he \"would not tolerate any actions against the Jews\", and that Korsemann subsequently denied he had any orders to do so.[38] He further claimed that he had only heard of the atrocities committed in Auschwitz after the war, although he was aware of the Oranienburg and Dachau concentration camps, where some of his friends and relatives were interned for political reasons.[38]\n\nAfter his forced retirement, Kleist was in contact with generals of the German resistance, although there is no direct evidence of his participation in the conspiracy against Hitler.[40][9] Khavkin opines that Kleist was not a Nazi, but a servant of a criminal regime and became involved in war crimes as a result.[9]\n\nKleist was arrested in late April 1945 in Mitterfels by the American 26th Infantry Division, and handed over to the British Army. Kleist testified in the Nuremberg trials. In September 1946, he was extradited to Yugoslavia, where he was tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison for war crimes. He also testified in Yugoslavia that Operation Retribution, the 1941 bombing of Belgrade, \"had a primarily political-terrorist character and had nothing to do with the war. That air bombing was a matter of Hitler\u2019s vanity, and his personal revenge.\"[41] Kleist was the highest ranking Wehrmacht commander to stand trial in Yugoslavia; the second-highest ranking commander was Generaloberst Alexander L\u00f6hr, who commanded German forces in Southeastern Europe and Operation Retribution. In 1947, L\u00f6hr was sentenced to death and executed for war crimes along with several other more junior Wehrmacht officers in Belgrade. The historian Khavkin opines that Kleist's trial and the evidence brought against him were partly political and that, although the Germans committed terrible war crimes in Yugoslavia, his personal guilt could not be proven.[9]\n\nIn 1949, he was extradited to the Soviet Union, where he was charged with war crimes.[42] Kleist was one of the three German field marshals captured by Soviet forces, the other two being Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner and Friedrich Paulus. The Soviet prosecutors presented evidence that Kleist carried out and issued criminal orders.[9] The verdict stated that in the Krasnodar territory alone, German forces, including units under the command of Kleist, killed more than 61,000 Soviet citizens, destroyed more than 63,000 industrial and economic buildings, looted from collective farms, stole hundreds of thousands of livestock, burned dozens of villages and destroyed many schools, hospitals and children's institutions.[9] Kleist was sentenced to 25 years in a correctional labour camp.[9][43]\n\nIn 1952, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court recognized Kleist as a particularly dangerous criminal and demanded strict isolation of him from society. Kleist's verdict was changed from a correctional labour camp term, to a prison term, and he was then sent to Vladimir Central Prison.[9]\n\nOn 13 November 1954, Kleist died of heart failure in Vladimir Central Prison. He was the most senior-ranking soldier among the German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union to die in Russian captivity.[44] Kleist was buried at the Prince Vladimir cemetery near the prison walls.\n\nIn October 1955, after German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's visit to Moscow, the Soviet Union repatriated the remaining 14,000 German prisoners of war convicted of war crimes. Kleist's body was exhumed, dressed in a field marshal's uniform and sent home to Germany.[45] Kleist had two sons, Johannes J\u00fcrgen Christoph Ewald and Hugo Edmund Christoph Heinrich.[46]\n"

        "text": "Frances Axler Goldin (June 22, 1924- May 16, 2020) was a housing rights activist and literary agent in New York City.[1] She was a founding member of the Metropolitan Council on Housing[2] and the Cooper Square Committee. Beginning in 1959, she led a successful campaign to defeat an urban renewal plan of Robert Moses, which would have replaced historic, affordable housing with a freeway in the Lower East Side. For decades, Goldin was associated with the Lower East Side, where she was a neighborhood preservationist and community figure.[3] The 175 Essex Building of Essex Crossing is named in her honor,[4] and she was profiled in the documentary It Took 50 Years.[5]\n\nFrances Goldin was born on June 22, 1924, and she grew up in Springfield Gardens, Queens. Her parents were working-class Jewish immigrants from Russia and Ukraine.[3][5] Her father, Michael Axler, was a toolmaker and mechanic for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).[6][7] Frances described him as a \"freethinker\" and \"very much a union man.\"[8] Her mother, Sophie (Saslowsky) Axler, was a homemaker and former seamstress who had been fired due to her union activity.[7]\n\nFrances had a difficult youth; she described her childhood as \"miserable.\" Her neighborhood was almost entirely Christian. She experienced antisemitism, and bricks flew at her family's window when they lit candles on Friday night for Shabbat on at least two occasions.[9] She also experienced class discrimination as a child. Many of the neighborhood families were wealthier, and neighborhood fathers often worked in business capacities.[5] As she later explained, \"I hated where we lived... We were one of nine Jewish families. The other eight Jewish families were shopkeepers. My father was a worker. So we were shunned by the non-Jews and shunned by the Jews, because my father worked with his hands.\"[8]\n\nAs a teen, Goldin attended Andrew Jackson High School, where she was valedictorian. Her parents expected her to become a traditional Jewish wife. Her mother wanted her to go to secretarial school rather than college.[7] During this time, Goldin met communists while working at the War Shipping Administration,[6] and \"they quickly converted me.\" When Goldin was 19 years old, she joined the Communist Party. She enrolled in the Jefferson School of Social Science, an adult education school that was founded and managed by the Communist Party USA. At Jefferson, Goldin studied the history of capitalism and socialism, and she read Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.[8]\n\nIn 1944, when Frances was 20 years old, she married Morris Goldin.[8] The couple had met through the Communist Party.[8] Morris was also a party member,[5] and he was a leader of the Government Workers\u2019 Union.[6] The couple moved to the Lower East Side in Manhattan, where they lived in a one-bedroom apartment in the fourth floor of a building.[8] In the Lower East Side, she found \"nirvana.\"[9] She explained, \"It was amazing to see people of different nationalities, colors, opinions, living together in harmony. And what bound them was poverty.\"[9][5]\n\nGoldin first became involved with housing rights activism when she visited the Lower East Side Tenement and Consumer Council.[8] At the time, she wanted to confirm that she was being charged the correct rent ($65 per month) by her landlord. After confirming that this was the case, \"...they said, 'You seem intelligent, would you like to come work in the tenant council and help us out?' I said sure, and I\u2019ve worked with the tenant council ever since. I never left,\" as she explained in an interview.[10]\n\nIn some of her early work, Frances helped translate and interpret for Yiddish speakers at the tenant clinic. She also met with local American Labor Party organizers.[8]\n\nIn 1950, when she was 27 years old, Goldin ran for the New York State Senate, as part of the American Labor Party.[1][2] The ticket also included W.E.B. DuBois. Due to these political activities, the Goldins were blacklisted and under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This resulted in her husband losing his job, and Frances became the sole income earner in the family.[5] She supported the family by working as a secretary.[3]\n\nIn 1959, she led an effort to oppose a Robert Moses plan to bulldoze twelve blocks of the Lower East Side, which was marketed as \"urban renewal.\" The plan was to build a proposed Cross-Manhattan Expressway, so that wealthy residents could more easily commute to Wall Street.[1][10] Through these efforts, Goldin co-founded Cooper Square Committee, along with Thelma Burdick and Walter Thabit.[9] The Committee advocates for affordable housing and tenant rights.[1] In 1961, the Committee released Alternate Plan for Cooper Square, which proposed the building of public housing on vacant lots. Through their pressures, a vote was made by the New York City Board of Estimate, which adopted the Alternate Plan for Cooper Square.[9] In total, the work of Goldin and the Committee saved 328 tenement apartments, and an additional 530 income-restricted apartments were later built in Cooper Square.[6]\n\nDespite these efforts, the Committee struggled to find wider support in local government until David Dinkins became mayor. In 1990, they signed a Memorandum of Understanding, which stated that they would oversee affordable housing development in neighborhood under the Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association.[9]\n\nFinally, in 2012, the Committee's plan came to fruition, after years of activism, when the city decided to develop a housing cooperative, where residents could buy their apartments for as little as $250 per unit.[9] She said, \"We organized and demonstrated and finally beat [Robert Moses] 50 years later.\"[10] The story of Cooper Square Committee has inspired other local groups that advocate for the poor in New York City, such as Picture the Homeless.\n\nGoldin was also a founding member of the Metropolitan Council for Housing, and she became an advocate for squatter rights.[2]\n\nIn the 1960s, Goldin was involved in the movement that advocated for former tenants of Seward Park. In total, 1800 residents had been displaced by Seward Park Urban Renewal Area on Delancey Street, with the evacuation process largely completed by 1959. The effort was initially led by Robert Moses, as part of his Slum Clearance Committee, and then continued to be led by other organizations and interests.[11][6] Goldin advocated for the right of the former tenants to return to their homes. The elite figures of the neighborhood represented the interests of the primarily assimilated, middle-class tenants. Meanwhile, the primarily Asian and Latino immigrant tenants represented a newer generation in the neighborhood. In 2018, after fifty years of struggle, a 100-unit low-income senior citizen building was completed in the area, where 50% of the units are allocated for affordable housing. The building was named Frances Goldin Houses in her honor.[6]\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Goldin began to work in a small literary agency, so she could begin to understand the publishing industry. Eventually, in 1977, Goldin launched Frances Goldin Literary Agency, which focused on left-wing writers. Her clients included Dorothy Allison, Staceyann Chin, Martin Duberman, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Barbara Kingsolver, Adrienne Rich, Robert Meeropol, Juan Gonzalez, and Mike Wallace.[3] She said, \"I do not market any material that is sexist, racist, homophobic or gratuitously violent.\" Many of the authors were included in Imagine: Living in a Socialist USA, published by Goldin, in 2014.[12][6]\n\nIn 2012, Goldin received the Michele Karlsberg Leadership Award from the Publishing Triangle.[13][14]\n\nGoldin was a recognizable figure in multiple protest movements and marches. She was a longtime advocate for LGBTQ rights and participated in the NYC Pride March for 35 years. She was known to carry a sign that read, \"I Adore my Lesbian Daughters KEEP THEM SAFE,\"[15] and she became a recognizable figure of the parades.[16]\n\nAs she aged, Goldin continued to protest. In 2011, Goldin was involved in the Occupy Wall Street protests. She was known to carry a sign that said, \u201cI\u2019m 87 and MAD AS HELL.\"[16] In 2018, when she was 92 years old, she participated in the Women's March in a wheelchair. She raised her fist and chanted, \"92 and Comin\u2019 Through!\u201d[6]\n\nFor many years, Goldin was known for her outspoken personality and distinctive style. In her old age, she had a neon purple streak in her white hair, and she wore a pin that said \"TAX THE RICH,\" which was pinned to a purple sweatshirt.[9]\n\nGoldin was married to Morris Goldin, a staff member of the New York State American Labor Party and advisor to Congressman Vito Marcantonio in East Harlem.[5] Frances and Morris divorced in 1971.[3] The couple had two daughters, Sally and Reeni, who are both lesbians. They both came out after their first pride parade in 1970.[16] Every year since then Goldin attended the NYC Pride Parade where she was always seen holding the same banner: \"I Adore My Lesbian Daughters- Keep Them Safe.\"[17]\n\nOn May 16, 2020, Goldin died[12] at her home on East 11th Street, where she had lived for nearly 50 years.[18] She had endured years of declining health before her death. She was 95 years old.[19] The New York Times called her a \"...protester, provocateur and voice for lost causes\" in its obituary.[3] The Indypendent dedicated a full page obituary to her, in which they wrote, \"Frances Goldin was relentless, her enthusiasm infectious. And her life shows the value of being a long distance runner.\" She is survived by her daughter Reeni Goldin and daughter-in-law Marge Burns, daughter Sally Goldin, and her grandson, Morris Goldin.[3]\n"

        "text": "\n\nThe Destiny of Me is a 1992 American play by Larry Kramer. The play follows Ned Weeks, a character from Kramer's 1985 play The Normal Heart. The play premiered off-Broadway in 1992, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\n\nThe Destiny of Me focuses on Ned Weeks, a character introduced in The Normal Heart, as he checks into the National Institutes of Health to undergo an experimental treatment for AIDS. Much of his story is told in flashback, as Ned recalls growing up as Alexander in a Jewish household where, as a hardcore theatre aficionado, he imitates Cornelia Otis Skinner and Mary Martin and adorns his bedroom with Broadway posters. He constantly is beaten by his father Richard, a government employee who never fulfilled the promise of his Yale education, for being \"different\" and a \"sissy,\" while his sympathetic but complacent mother Rena fails to intervene. Meanwhile, both parents dote on his brother Benjamin, who grows up to become a successful attorney with a dazzling career.\n\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway, produced by the Circle Repertory Company, at the Lucille Lortel Theatre on October 11, 1992 and closed on March 21, 1993 after 198 performances. Directed by Marshall W. Mason, the cast included John Cameron Mitchell as  Alexander, Jonathan Hadary as Ned, David Spielberg as Richard, Piper Laurie as Rena, and Peter Frechette as Benjamin.[1]\n\nLarry Kramer was nominated for the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.[2]\n[3] Kramer won the Obie Award and the 1993 Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Play, and John Cameron Mitchell won the Obie Award, Performance, and was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as Best Actor in a play.[1]\n\nA one-night only benefit reading was held of the play in 2018, presented by The New Group. The reading featured Mark Ruffalo reprising his role as Ned Weeks from the film adaptation of The Normal Heart, Lee Pace as Benjamin, Ellen Barkin as Rena, Eric Bogosian as Richard, Gideon Glick as Alexander, and Josh Hamilton as Dr. Thomas Hamilton. Edie Falco read the stage directions.[4]\n\nFrank Rich of The New York Times observed, \"No one can accuse Mr. Kramer of being a boy who cried wolf. History may judge this impossible, reflexively contentious man a patriot. But what makes The Destiny of Me so fascinating, and at times overwhelmingly powerful, is not so much its expected single-mindedness about AIDS as its unexpectedly relentless pursuit of the crusader at center stage. Mr. Kramer cannot solve the medical mystery of the virus or the psychological mystery of the world's tardy response to the peril. What he can try to crack is his own mystery: Why was he of all people destined to scream bloody murder with the aim of altering the destiny of the human race? The writing in The Destiny of Me can fall short of Mr. Kramer's ambitions, but it is never less than scaldingly honest.\" He continued, \"Not by happenstance is The Destiny of Me a juicy, three-act memory play in the mode of that Arthur Miller-Tennessee Williams era, with occasional flashes of humor reminiscent of latter-day variations on the form by Neil Simon and Herb Gardner... Given the conventionality of Mr. Kramer's dramatic format, one sometimes wishes the dialogue fleshing it out were finer. He has a good ear, but it is the ear of a journalist, not a poet.\"[5]\n\nIn December 2014, after the success of the film adaptation of The Normal Heart, it was reported that Kramer was set to write an adaptation The Destiny of Me for HBO, with Ryan Murphy returning to direct the film, and Mark Ruffalo, Julia Roberts and Jim Parsons mentioned as potentially reprising their roles.[6]\n"

        "text": "World Mosquito Day, observed annually on 20 August, is a commemoration of British doctor Sir Ronald Ross's discovery in 1897 that female anopheline mosquitoes transmit malaria between humans.[1] Prior to the discovery of the transmitting organism, vector, there were few means for controlling the spread of the disease although the discovery of quinine in treatment had alleviated the problem of treatment. According to one survey, nearly half the world population was at significant risk from malaria in the 19th century with a 10% mortality among those infected.[2] Ross had already conducted experiments with Culex (possibly C. fatigans) fed on birds infected with bird malaria Protesoma relictum (now Plasmodium relictum) in 1894 and noted that they developed in mosquito gut and had surmised that the same may happen in malaria.[3] The discovery was made in a small laboratory in Begumpet area of Secunderabad, Hyderabad. Today the laboratory is known as the Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Parasitology and houses a small museum on Ross and his malaria research.[1] Ross had noted the day of the discovery made in Secunderabad (printed incorrectly as 1895, but definitely 1897 based on his postings).[4] \nThe 20 August 1895 [sic]-the anniversary of which I always call Mosquito Day - was, I think, a cloudy, dull hot day. I went to hospital at 7 a.m., examined my patients, and attended to official correspondence; but was much annoyed because my men had failed to bring any more larvae of the dappled-winged mosquitoes, and still more because one of my three remaining Anopheles had died during the night and had swelled up with decay. After a hurried breakfast at the Mess, I returned to dissect the cadaver (Mosquito 36), but found nothing new in it. I then examined a small Stegomyia, which happened to have been fed on Husein Khan on the same day (the 16th) \u2014Mosquito 87\u2014which was also negative, of course. At about I p.m. I determined to sacrifice the seventh Anopheles (A. stephensi) of the batch fed on the 16th, Mosquito 38, although my eyesight was already fatigued. Only one more of the batch remained.\n\nThe London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine holds Mosquito Day celebrations every year, including events such as parties and exhibitions, a tradition dating back to as early as the 1930s.[5]\n\n\n\nThis festival-related article is a stub.

Water is poured on this brown crust and the contents are put to a simmer until the water gains enough flavor of the scorched rice.[1]\n\nRecords of sungnyung can be found in the late Joseon era documents of Imwon Gyeongjeji (\uc784\uc6d0\uacbd\uc81c\uc9c0).\n\nRice in Korea was traditionally made by using a heavy iron cauldron (like a Dutch oven), with the rice being cooked until all water had been boiled away and a crust made on the bottom of the pot.[2] Making sungnyung would not only prevent waste of the remaining rice that was sticking to the pot, it would also naturally clear out the pot's insides which made cleaning easier. As sungnyung was made after rice had been served, it was typically served after the meal.[1]\n\nThe consumption of sungnyung waned as nickel-silver pots and modern electric rice cookers gained popularity, as they do not generally leave a layer of roasted crust after the rice is steamed.[1] However, in the late 20th century sungnyung began to gain popularity again and many electric rice cookers now come with the ability to cook sungnyung.[3] Prepackaged nurungji are also commercially available and can be used to make sungnyung in a short of amount of time by just adding boiling water.[4]\n"

The hotel was notable for several firsts: It was the first fireproof building in Mississippi, and the first hotel to break the state's color barrier in 1964 in reversing its policy to allow African-Americans to book hotel rooms. Other local hotels followed shortly thereafter. The hotel also held the premier concert of the newly-formed Jackson Symphony Orchestra in 1944,[1] was the site of John F. Kennedy's first speech in the southern United States in 1957, and then a destination for senators Joseph S. Clark and Robert F. Kennedy in 1967 when on a fact-finding tour of the Mississippi Delta.\n\nThe hotel opened its doors on May 1, 1922. The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson's newspaper, dedicated two pages of its April 30 Sunday edition to the opening of the five-story hotel, which was described the first fire-proof building in the state of Mississippi.[2] The hotel opened with 124 rooms, all boasting an electric fan.[3]\n\nIn 1930, Heidelberg and hotel manager J.L. Latimer acquired A.H. Alvis's interest in the hotel and spent $200,000 on a renovation, which included adding three stories to the original building.[4]\n\nAnother $250,000 renovation followed in 1955, which added two banquet rooms on the 13th and 14th stories of the hotel, and modernized the lobby's furnishings.[5]\n\nOn October 17, 1957, the hotel was the site of John F. Kennedy's first campaign speech in the southern United States. Kennedy made a statement supporting school integration to a packed room of Mississippi Democrats in the hotel's Victory Room and Foyer.[6][7]\n\nAfter Roy Heidelberg's death, the hotel was leased to Alvin Grubbs and Arthur Landstreet in 1959, who continued to renovate the hotel.[8]\n\nIn July 1964, two NAACP members, Dr. H. Claude Hudson and Kenneth Guscott, checked into the Heidelberg, ending the city of Jackson's segregationist policies with regards to its downtown hotels.[9]\n\nAccording to a newspaper columnist who was served the drink, the hotel served the first legal drink in Jackson after Mississippi's prohibition law was repealed in 1966.[10]\n\nThe hotel was the headquarters of the 60th NAACP convention in 1969.[11]\n\nThe American Hotel Operators Group leased the building starting in September 1973. However, the hotel cancelled the lease in April 1974 after the group's owner was indicted for giving false information to a bank, leaving the hotel $250,000 in debt.[12]\n\nThe hotel closed on November 14, 1974. The hotel's downtown location could not compete with newer chain hotels. A $2 million renovation would have been required to bring the hotel up to modern standards, but the money was not available. At the hotel's closing, the manager hoped someone would renovate and reopen the hotel.[13][14]\n\nIn May 1976, the Jackson Redevelopment Authority purchased the building for $550,000 and announced their intention to raze the building in August.[15]\nThe building's liquidation sale occurred in November 1976 with demolition proceeding the following January and occurring through 1977 due to a short-staffed demolition contractor.[16][17]\n\n32\u00b017\u203259\u2033N 90\u00b011\u203214\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff32.299855\u00b0N 90.187335\u00b0W\ufeff / 32.299855; -90.187335\n"

        "title": "Leghemoglobin",
        "text": "Leghemoglobin (also leghaemoglobin or legoglobin) is an oxygen-carrying phytoglobin found in the nitrogen-fixing root nodules of leguminous plants. It is produced by these plants in response to the roots being colonized by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, termed rhizobia, as part of the symbiotic interaction between plant and bacterium: roots not colonized by Rhizobium do not synthesise leghemoglobin. Leghemoglobin has close chemical and structural similarities to hemoglobin, and, like hemoglobin, is red in colour. It was originally thought that the heme prosthetic group for plant leghemoglobin was provided by the bacterial symbiont within symbiotic root nodules.[1][2] However, subsequent work shows that the plant host strongly expresses heme biosynthesis genes within nodules, and that activation of those genes correlates with leghemoglobin gene expression in developing nodules.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]\n\nIn plants colonised by Rhizobium, such as alfalfa or soybeans, the presence of oxygen in the root nodules would reduce the activity of the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase, which is an enzyme responsible for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. Leghemoglobin is shown to buffer the concentration of free oxygen in the cytoplasm of infected plant cells to ensure the proper function of root nodules. That being said, nitrogen fixation is an extremely energetically costly process, so aerobic respiration, which necessitates high oxygen concentration, is necessary in the cells of the root nodule.[11] Leghemoglobin maintains a free oxygen concentration that is low enough to allow nitrogenase to function, but a high enough total oxygen concentration (free and bound to leghemoglobin) for aerobic respiration.\n\nLeghemoglobin falls into the class of symbiotic globins, which also include the root nodules globins of actinorhizal plants such as Casuarina. The Casuarina symbiotic globin is intermediate between leghemoglobin and nonsymbiotic phytoglobin-2.[12][13]\n\nLeghemoglobins are monomeric proteins with a mass around 16 kDa, and are structurally similar to myoglobin.[14] One leghemoglobin protein consists of a heme bound to an iron, and one polypeptide chain (the globin).[14] Similar to myoglobin and hemoglobin, the iron of heme is found in its ferrous state in vivo, and is the moiety that binds oxygen.[14] Despite similarities in the mechanism of oxygen binding between leghemoglobin and animal hemoglobin, and the fact that leghemoglobin and animal hemoglobin evolved from a common ancestor, there is dissimilarity in amino acid sequence between these proteins at about 80% of positions.[14]\n\nOxygen binding affinities of leghemoglobins are between 11 and 24 times higher than oxygen binding affinities of sperm whale myoglobin.[15] Differences in the affinities are due to differential rates of association between the two types of proteins.[15] One explanation of this phenomenon is that in myoglobin, a bound water molecule is stabilized in a pocket surrounding the heme group. This water group must be displaced in order for oxygen to bind. No such water is bound in the analogous pocket of leghemoglobin, so it is easier for an oxygen molecule to approach the leghemoglobin heme.[14] Leghemoglobin has a slow oxygen dissociation rate, similar to myoglobin.[16] Like myoglobin and hemoglobin, leghemoglobin has a high affinity for carbon monoxide.[16]\n\nIn the primary structure of Leghemoglobin A in soybeans, a valine(F7) is found in place where a serine(F7) is in Myoglobin. Without a hydrogen bond fixing the orientation of the proximal histidine side chain the imidazole ring can occupy a staggered conformation between pyrrole nitrogen atoms and can readily move upward to the heme plane. This greatly increases the reactivity of the iron atom and oxygen affinity. In Leghemoglobin A the distal histidine side chain is also rotated away from the bound ligand by formation of a hydrogen bond with Tyrosine.[17]\n\nHeme groups are the same in all known leghemoglobins, but the amino acid sequence of the globin differs slightly depending on bacterial strain and legume species.[14] Even within one leguminous plant, multiple isoforms of leghemoglobins can exist. These often differ in oxygen affinity, and help meet the needs of a cell in a particular environment within the nodule.[18]\n\nResults of a 1995 study suggested that the low free oxygen concentration in root nodule cells is actually due to the low oxygen permeability of root nodule cells.[19] It follows that the main purpose of leghemoglobin is to scavenge the limited free oxygen in the cell and deliver it to mitochondria for respiration. But, scientists of a later 2005 article suggest that leghemoglobin is responsible both for buffering oxygen concentration, and for delivery of oxygen to mitochondria.[20] Their leghemoglobin knockout studies showed that leghemoglobin actually does significantly decrease the free oxygen concentration in root nodule cells, and that nitrogenase expression was eliminated in leghemoglobin knockout mutants, assumably due to the degradation of nitrogenase with high free oxygen concentration. Their study also showed a higher ATP/ADP ratio in wild-type root nodule cells with active leghemoglobin, suggesting that leghemoglobin also assists with delivery of oxygen for respiration. \n\nPlants contain both symbiotic and nonsymbiotic hemoglobins. Symbiotic hemoglobins are thought to be important for symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF). In legume, SNF takes place in specialized organs called nodules which contain bacteroids, or nitrogen fixing rhizobia. The induction of nodule-specific plant genes, which include those that encode for symbiotic leghemoglobins (Lb), accompany nodule development. Leghemoglobins accumulate to millimolar concentrations in the cytoplasm of infected plant cells prior to nitrogen fixation to buffer free oxygen in the nanomolar range, which can avoid inactivation of oxygen-labile nitrogenase while keeping a high enough oxygen flux for respiration in the cell. The leghemoglobins are required for SNF but are not required for plant growth and development in the presence of an external source of fixed nitrogen. Leghemoglobins make the essential contribution of establishing low free-oxygen concentrations while keep a high energy status in cells. These are the conditions necessary for effective SNF.[20]\n\nGlobins have since been identified as a protein common to many plant taxa, not restricted to symbiotic ones. In light of this discovery, it has been proposed that the term phytoglobins be used for referring to plant globins in general.[12]\n\nPhytoglobins can be divided into two clades. The 3/3-fold type contains Classes I and II of angiosperm phytoglobins, and is the one common to all eukaryotes (HGT of a bacterial flavohemoglobin). The leghemoglobin sensu stricto is a class II phytoglobin. The 2/2-fold \"TrHb2\" type contains class III in angiosperm nomenclature, and appears to be acquired from Chloroflexota (formerly Chloroflexi) by the ancestor of land plants.[12]\n\nImpossible Foods asked the American FDA for their approval to use recombinant soy leghemoglobin in meat alternatives as an analog of meat-derived hemoglobin.[21][22] Approval from the FDA came in July 2019,[23] was challenged,[a] and later upheld, on May 3, 2021, by a San Francisco federal appeals court.[24][25] It is currently being used in their products to mimic the color, taste, and texture of meat.[26]\n"

        "text": "\n\nHoward Thomas CBE (5 March 1909 \u2013 6 November 1986) was a Welsh radio producer and television executive.\n\nThomas began his career typing invoices for a firm of wire-drawers in Manchester. While doing that job, he taught himself to write newspaper articles and short plays. When some of these articles were published, he managed to get a job in the firm's advertising department. That job enabled Thomas to mix with advertising agents and through networking he obtained a position with F John Roe, one of Manchester's advertising agencies.\n\nHe moved to the London agency F C Prichard Wood and Partners, and he continued to write articles, having a London entertainment column in the Manchester Evening Chronicle. This column was spotted by the London Press Exchange and he was hired by them as a copywriter.\n\nAt London Press Exchange, Thomas worked in the commercial radio section, at first writing, then producing commercial packages for companies including Cadbury's. These packages, usually of music or variety acts interspersed with subtle commercials for the sponsor, were then placed on Radio Luxembourg and similar longwave broadcasters who could be heard in the UK.\n\nIn this position, he came to the attention of the BBC, and he began to submit scripts and programme ideas to them while continuing to work for the international commercial broadcasters. However, at the outbreak of World War II, the commercial broadcasters closed and the advertising market contracted. Thomas kept his post at London Press Exchange, but effectively had no work to do. He attempted to fill time by writing books about the blackout and writing more articles for newspapers, and also worked for Publicity Films Limited producing public information films.\n\nOn the outbreak of war, the BBC had closed its existing two Regional Programme and National Programme stations and replaced them with a single national station, the Home Service (now BBC Radio 4).\n\nThis move was criticised as it led to boredom amongst the listeners during the Phony War, who were also faced with cinemas and sporting events being closed \"for the duration\" and the loss of the competition to the BBC.\n\nAs the Phony War ended, the BBC decided to introduce an entertainment-based national radio station, primarily for the men under arms. The new service, the Forces Programme hired many new producers from the former commercial agencies, including Howard Thomas.\n\nThomas's first assignment was to produce the programme Ack Ack Beer Beer, an entertainment and variety programme for anti-aircraft and barrage balloon emplacements. Both jobs featured very little action and therefore the BBC felt that 'lively' entertainment had to be provided for the crews.\n\nUnder Thomas, the programme developed into a miscellany of variety, talk, music and comedy, using whatever talent was available near the evacuated Variety Department's studios in Bristol. On occasion this was no talent at all, and Thomas later told of an edition made up of him and his co-producer playing \"Shove ha'penny\", which had the side effect of reintroducing the game to the population.\n\nWith Bristol now a victim of the Blitz, the Variety Department moved to Bangor in north Wales. However, feeling that opportunities for variety would be limited there, Thomas engineered a move back to London.\n\nIn London he spotted singer Vera Lynn in a stage show. He created a radio programme for her called Sincerely Yours, Vera Lynn where she sang popular tunes of the time, read out letters from servicemen and introduced entertainers.\n\nThe show was a hit, both with the forces and the country at large, although the senior officers of both the British Army and the Royal Navy strongly objected to the sentimental and \"soppy\" music and presentation. Nevertheless, the show helped turn the song \"We'll Meet Again\" into one of the best selling pieces of music throughout the war. The show also cemented Vera Lynn's title of \"forces' sweetheart\" and ensured that she would remain, as of 2006, something akin to a national treasure in the UK.\n\nTo assuage critics of Sincerely Yours, Thomas introduced the programme I Am John Bull, featuring military marches and \"strong\" music. The programme was not successful.\n\nThe BBC Forces Programme provided distinct programming for each of the armed services. However, the Merchant Navy, not being classed as an armed service and under the patronage of the Ministry of Labour, was not included.\n\nHoward Thomas began a programme named Shipmates Ashore aimed at this audience. The programme was set in a Merchant Navy club and quickly became an effectively real club, with free beer and \"companionship\" for visiting merchant seamen. The show featured a mixture of music, singing, comedy and information (in the form of a \"ship's newspaper\") as well as providing a platform for discussion of issues of interest to the sailors. The programme was presented by Doris Hare.\n\nAs conceived by Howard Thomas and Douglas Cleverdon, The Brains Trust was a simple mixture of light panel game entertainment and heavier discussion of items of scientific, legal, medical and social importance. At that time, there was much discussion in the UK about the shape of the world and the country after the war, which reached its peak with the Beveridge Report and the 1945 landslide election of Attlee's Labour government.\n\nThe programme featured Professor Cyril E. M. Joad, previously rejected for radio for his strange speaking voice; the writer and zoologist Julian Huxley; and the loud and entertaining Archibald Bruce Campbell. The programme first aired under the title Any Questions? and drew a small audience and few questions. However, within a few weeks it had caught the zeitgeist of the nation, gaining an audience of 11\u00bdmillion. The series was extended from a run of 12 episodes into an open-ended series that ran into the 1950s.\n\nHowever, the popularity of the programme, dealing as it did with matters of controversy and politics, caused complaints of left-wing bias from within the BBC and from commentators outside. The BBC attempted to modify the format of the programme to avoid this but also sought to avoid damaging the shows popularity. With military criticism of Sincerely Yours, general complaints about the bawdy humour in Shipmates Ashore and political criticism of The Brains Trust, the BBC sought a scapegoat and pressured Howard Thomas to leave. In 1944, he resigned.\n\nOn leaving the BBC, Howard Thomas joined the Associated British Picture Corporation as head of British Path\u00e9, the newsreel and film company.\n\nThomas relaunched the ailing Path\u00e9 Gazette as Path\u00e9 News, began hiring new cameramen and pioneered the switch to colour film. He also arranged for the Path\u00e9 archives, then of little or no intrinsic value to the company, to be indexed and properly preserved for future use.\n\nBy the 1950s, it was becoming clear that television was eroding the size of cinema audiences. Frustrated at his inability to convince the Associated British Picture Corporation that it should either expand into production of popular feature films or bid for one of the new commercial broadcasting licences offered under the Television Act 1954 by the Independent Television Authority (ITA), Howard Thomas began to look for roles in the new ITV companies that were being started.\n\nHe was offered the job of General Manager of Kemsley-Winnick Television, the new weekend contractor for the midlands and north of England. However, before he could take up the job, Lord Kemsley pulled out of the company and the contract lapsed.\n\nThe ITA made a last-ditch attempt to get the Associated British Picture Corporation involved in commercial television as a replacement for Kemsley-Winnick. The board of the company was finally convinced to try, and signed a contract with the ITA on 21 September 1955 to form Associated British Cinemas (Television) Limited (ABC) to take over the contract.\n\nHoward Thomas was appointed as managing director of the company and hired Sydney Newman and Brian Tesler as his controllers of drama and light entertainment respectively.\n\nIn 1966, the ITA announced that the pattern of broadcasting for Independent Television was to change from 1968. All contractors would be required to reapply for their contracts, and, though there would be one more contract available than before (for Yorkshire), the previous weekend splits in the three central regions of London, the midlands and the north of England would be altered. The London split would change to Friday evenings (rather than the self-contained weekend it had previously been) and the midlands and the north would be redivided into three whole-week regions. ABC's contract area would therefore cease to exist.\n\nHoward Thomas had planned for ABC Television to apply for the extended London weekends contract (with an application for the Midlands seven-day contract as a stand-by). However, the appearance of a consortium of major figures from the BBC and Rediffusion under the leadership of David Frost made this difficult. The London Television Consortium (later London Weekend Television) won the contract, and the ITA was left with no place for ABC.\n\nThe ITA's solution was to ask ABC and Rediffusion to merge to form a new company. They specified that ABC would have a slim majority of the shares, and that the managing director would be Howard Thomas. In practice, the merger proved impossible due to outside interests held by both parent companies. Instead, the parent companies formed a joint company called Thames Television Holdings Limited (trading as Thames Television), the shares of which were 51% owned by ABC and 49% owned by Rediffusion, with profits being shared equally. This company took over the staff of ABC in Teddington and a minority of staff from Rediffusion. Management and on-screen talent was mainly provided by former ABC staff.\n\nThames retained the London weekdays licence until 31 December 1992.\n\nThe Independent Broadcasting Authority set a limit on the age of managing directors of ITV companies, specifying that they retire at the age of 75.\n\nWhen Howard Thomas reached this age, Thames Television Holdings (the company that held the shares in Thames formerly held by the now-defunct Associated British Picture Corporation) promoted him from Thames Television to become chairman of Thames Television International \u2013 then a subsidiary of Thames but previously known as EMI Films and, before that, the remains of the former ABC owner Associated British Picture Corporation.\n\nHoward Thomas married Hilda in 1934 and they had two daughters, Rosemary and Carol.\n\nHe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1967.\n"

        "text": "\n\nRuby Wilson (February 29, 1948 \u2013 August 12, 2016) was an American blues and gospel singer. She was known as \"The Queen of Beale Street\" as she sang in clubs on Beale Street, Memphis, Tennessee, for over 40 years. She had a successful touring and recording career, and appeared in a number of films.[2]\n\nWilson was born in Fort Worth, Texas, United States, the youngest in a family of six children. Her mother was a maid, her father was self-employed, and Wilson grew up picking and chopping cotton - work she later described as hot and unpleasant.[3]\n\nWilson's upbringing was filled with music, from two quite different sources - her mother, a deeply religious woman, only allowed her children to listen to gospel music, as she believed that all other music was \"the devil's music\". Wilson's mother was the choir director at their family church, and when she was 7 years old Wilson began singing in her mother's choir. On the other hand, Wilson's father loved blues and Wilson listened with him to blues musicians, which had a strong influence on her future career.[3]\n\nWilson met B.B. King for the first time when she was 14; King offered to be her godfather, and the two became close.[3][4] When she was 15 years old, singer Shirley Caesar heard Wilson singing at church and invited her to tour with her as a backing singer.[3][5] The following year, Wilson moved to Chicago, where she became a church choir director and sang gospel. She later returned to Texas and started singing jazz.[3]\n\nWilson moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1972, and started working as a kindergarten teacher in the Memphis City School system.[3] She also began performing regularly in clubs on Beale Street, including The Peabody, Club Handy and Club Royale, with musicians such as Ray Charles, Isaac Hayes, and the Four Tops.[6] When B.B. King opened his B.B. King's Blues Club, she was given a weekly residency there, and when he later opened a restaurant, Itta Bena, she also became a regular performer there.[7]\n\nAs Wilson's career developed, she toured the United States and internationally, and performed at blues and jazz festivals in Europe, Asia and New Zealand.[5][6] She performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and for President Clinton and Vice-President Gore, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Rainier III of Monaco and his son Prince Albert.[3] Wilson also performed on cruise ships and river cruises, and at parties and corporate events. Some of the bands which she performed with were the Hot Cotton Jazz Band, Buck Bubbles Express, the Unknown Band, the King Beez, B. B. King All Stars, Ms. Ruby\u2019s Band and the Detroit People\u2019s Band.[3]\n\nIn the 1980s, Wilson spent some years living in Los Angeles and performed with Joan Rivers and Sharon Gless.[3]\n\nIn 1976 she was offered her first record contract, with Malaco Records.[3] Her first album, Ruby Wilson, was released by Malaco in 1981, and she released a further nine albums in her career. Two, Cake Walking Babies (1988) and Outstanding In Their Field (1989) were recorded with the Hot Cotton Jazz Band.[8]\n\nWilson appeared in several films, including The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), The Chamber (1996), Cookie's Fortune (1999) and Black Snake Moan (2006) as well as in television commercials.[5][9][10]\n\nIn 1992, after 20 years of singing in Beale Street clubs, local TV station WMC-TV gave her the title \"Queen Ambassador of Beale Street\"; two years later this was amended to \"The Queen of Beale Street\".[3]\n\nIn 2006, Wilson received the Memphis Sound Award for Best Entertainer;[11] in 2010, she was inducted into the Black Business Directory's African-American Hall of Fame.[7]\n\nIn 2012, Wilson was offered space to exhibit items from her career, and later that year the Ruby Wilson Museum was opened. It displays memorabilia including awards, outfits and photographs.[3] In 2013, Wilson received a W.C. Handy Heritage Awards Lifetime Achievement Award.[3]\n\nThe Beale Street Walk of Fame includes a brass note recognising Wilson's contribution to the street's music.[12]\n\nWilson was married four times. Her first husband was a gospel entertainer from Chicago. Her fourth  husband was B.B. King's road manager.[3]\n\nWilson suffered a stroke in 2009, and was unable to speak for four months. She received speech therapy and physical therapy and eventually recovered enough to return to acting and singing.[2][3] She suffered a heart attack in 2016, and after several days in a coma died on August 12, aged 68.[2]\n\nShe was survived by four children, twelve grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.[5][7]\n"

B.A.P released their first single in January 2012.\n\nBang Yong-guk was born in Seoul, South Korea, on March 31, 1990.[1] He is the youngest out of two sons and one daughter in his family. He has an identical twin brother named Yongnam, who has also performed as an underground artist, and an older sister named Natasha,[2] who works as a tattoo artist.\n\nHe moved with his family to the coastal Ijak islands of Incheon when he was young, living there for a short period of time before moving back to mainland Incheon.[2]  He studied at Gae Woong Elementary School and Gae Woong Middle School, and at 18 graduated from Yuhan High School. He was offered a scholarship for college, which he did not attend.[citation needed]\n\nBang first began meeting with other members of Soul Connection when he was in his second year of middle school after posting his rap lyrics on an online forum and being recognized for his skill. Through meeting with seniors that were actually active in the music industry, watching them compose and produce, and learning from them, he was able to refine his own techniques and become better at making his style of music[3][unreliable source?]\n\nIn 2010, Bang was contacted by TS Entertainment to be part of a hip-hop idol group after the duo Untouchable recommended him. Though he was worried that the type of music he could make would be limited, TS Entertainment assured him of being able to live out his dreams. Thus, he joined.\n\nOn March 3, 2011, Song Ji-eun's single \"Going Crazy\" was released, featuring Bang.[4][unreliable source?] The single was a commercial and critical success, with fans praising Bang's \"husky and fiery delivery\".[5][6][full citation needed] It topped the Gaon Music Chart and Gaon Digital and Streaming Chart[5] and gained attention for Bang as an artist; following the single's release, he trended on major portal search sites in South Korea[6] and was requested for multiple broadcast appearances.

Diddy, and Pharrell as musical influences.[31][unreliable source?] Although his goal was not initially to become a K-pop artist, he was influenced by the roles that Supreme Team and Dynamic Duo played in popularizing the genre in South Korea.[2] His voice type has been described as baritone.[32]\n\nBang also pulls influence from jazz and blues as well as rock/metal and alt-rock.[citation needed]\n\nAs well as rapping, Bang also acts as a songwriter and producer for many of B.A.P's songs, including all the tracks from their debut EP Warrior[33][34][unreliable source?] as well as tracks on various albums including Noir, Carnival, and Matrix. Furthermore, Bang is the lyricist for all B.A.P's songs, and takes influence from his life as well as world events. Bang identifies as a pacifist, and is vocal about his own struggles with mental health as well as his concern for the state of the world. Many of his lyrics openly criticise society, government, companies, and those that take advantage of power or influence to discriminate against others.[citation needed]\n\nBang drew inspiration for his solo album Bang Yongguk from the contents of his own diary. A personal album, songs on the album range from rage to loss to confrontations on depression and anxiety, to his own loneliness. The track \"See You Later\" is taken from a draft will as written in his diary.[35]\n\nBang is credited on his self-titled album as executive producer, lyricist, track producer, and art director, and self-directs videos for his solo work from conception to editing.[citation needed]\n"

It was the second in a series of paintings on the same subject produced between 1912 and 1913, and presented at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, in 1913. The current painting is held at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de Paris.[1]\n\nRobert Delaunay was very involved in the artistic movements of the beginning of the 20th century. After going through neoimpressionism and divisionism, he created simultanism, with his wife, Sonia Delaunay, a technique which aimed to create pictorial harmony through the simultaneous arrangement of colors. Like his friends Guillaume Apollinaire and Blaise Cendrars, Delaunay was fascinated by modernity, whether by the exploits of aviators, like he shows in his Homage to Bl\u00e9riot, or in here by the sport of rugby, then in full expansion and already very popular in France and the British Isles. Delaunay took inspiration of a photograph that he saw in a magazine of a rugby game for the painting series of which this was the second made.[2]\n\nThe painting depicts a game where a rugby team from Cardiff, in Wales, is participating, facing an unnamed adversary, possibly a French team. Six rugby players are shown in the lower part of the work, in sporting attires and in action, with their brightly colored jerseys made of crude lines. Three players have the same white and blue stripped jerseys, while the other three sportsmen belong to the opposite team. One of them is seen jumping while catching the ball. On the upper level of the painting there is an advertising poster with the slogan \u201cAstra\u201d and behind it some of the great inventions and creations of the time: a biplane, a rollercoaster and the Eiffel Tower. The name Delaunay can be seen at the bottom of the tower in a sort of advertisement, with the names of the cities of New York and Paris below.[3][4]\n\nDuring the same period, Delaunay painted Windows, a series which is closer to abstract art. But, in the series dedicated to the Cardiff Team, the painting cannot be considered abstract, because there are many elements of everyday life visible: the rugby players, an advertising board, the Eiffel Tower, a rollercoaster. This series is, however, according to Pascal Rousseau, a vibrant manifesto of simultanism, much more than the Windows series.[5]\n"

        "title": "Before These Crowded Streets",
        "text": "\n\nBefore These Crowded Streets is the third studio album by the American rock band Dave Matthews Band. It was released on April 28, 1998, through RCA Records. The album was produced by Steve Lillywhite, his last collaboration with the group until 2012's Away from the World. Recording took place at The Plant Recording Studios in Sausalito, California and Electric Lady Studios in New York.[1]\n\nTaking its title from a line in \"The Dreaming Tree\", the album marked a shift in the band's sound, having darker themes and textures and more complex arrangements. Certain songs see the band apply polyrhythms and Middle-Eastern scales.[2] Numerous guests are featured on the album, including B\u00e9la Fleck, Alanis Morissette and the Kronos Quartet. Additionally, guitarist Tim Reynolds guests on every track; he would later join the band as a full-time member. Lyrically, the album tackles both personal and socio-political themes, such as war in \"The Last Stop\" and the slaughter of Native Americans in \"Don't Drink the Water\".\n\nBefore These Crowded Streets was a critical and commercial success. The album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, selling 421,000 units in its first week of release and knocking the Titanic soundtrack from the top of the chart after a run of 16 consecutive weeks at number one.[3] Three singles were released from the album\u2014\"Don't Drink the Water\", \"Stay (Wasting Time)\", and \"Crush\"\u2014all of which received varying levels of commercial success.\n\nAt the end of many tracks on the album, there are \"musical interludes\" most of which consist of small jams or outtakes not developed into full songs:\n\nSongs that were recorded during the sessions, but were not included on the final cut:[4]\n\n\n\"MacHead\" was a song recorded during the album's sessions, but it was never completed, so did not make the album. Producer Steve Lillywhite named the song, claiming it sounded like a cross between the sound of Paul McCartney and Radiohead.[5] The song's existence is only known from an image on the 1999 fan calendar with a list of the working titles of the other songs on this album and from an alleged meeting in which Jake Vigliotti claims to have heard said recording.\n\"[MacHead] is a song that we were working on for [Before] These Crowded Streets and it's a song that we just never got to completion before we finished the album. Who knows, maybe one of these days we'll finish it and record it again, but we finished the album before we finished the song.\"[6]\nSome fans familiar with the idea of \"MacHead\" speculated it had been developed, renamed, and added to the band's catalog.[5] They speculate that \"MacHead\" developed into \"Bartender\", which debuted in January 1999 at a Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds concert just months after the April '98 release of Before These Crowded Streets. In November 2009, Jake Vigliotti claims to have heard 6 different demo takes of \"Machead\" from an early 1997 recording session for the album,[7] effectively confirming its existence to the fan community.[8]\n\nIn a 2010 interview with Cali from CBS Radio, Stefan Lessard was asked to give his thoughts on Machead. He replied that \"Machead's this little number that I believe was the last song to possibly make it on Before These Crowded Streets and I think there's a recording I have of it somewhere. So it's just finding a recording of it and listening to it and that's on our homework list.\"[9] Although as of July 2024, no official recording has surfaced, a demo recording has leaked and has been spread among fans.\n\nBefore These Crowded Streets received generally positive reviews from critics. Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J. D. Considine stated that with the album, the band had \"improved on every level\", praising the writing, playing and ambition of the arrangements.[10] Additionally, he praised the band for integrating many guests on the album and for \"broadening [their] palette\".[10] Mark Weingarten, writing for the Los Angeles Times, highlighted the tracks \"Rapunzel\" and \"The Stone\" in particular for their \"vertiginous polyrhythms and serpentine riffs that dart around Matthew's clenched vocals, yet always manage to lock into an enjoyable groove.\"[13]\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that despite the \"songwriting remain[ing] a problem\" and finding Matthews' lyrics occasionally \"embarrassing\", the album's \"sonic daring results in the most satisfying album they've yet recorded.\"[2] Another retrospective review came from Pitchfork's Jason P. Woodbury, who wrote that it \"remains DMB's most experimental album, a crossroads in the band's history\" and stated that it \"explores the uneasy zone between celebratory anthems and grim lamentations\".[14]\n\nSpecial guest Tim Reynolds is featured on all tracks.\n\nDave Matthews Band\n\nwith special guest:\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nTechnical\n\n\n\n\n\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\u2021 Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n"

        "text": "The Council of Jerusalem of 536 was a meeting of Chalcedonian representatives of the church of the Three Palestines (Prima, Secunda, Tertia) to condemn certain persons accused of the Monophysite heresy. It was convoked at the initiative the Roman emperor Justinian I following the forced resignation of the Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople in February or March, an event in which Pope Agapetus I had played the main role.[1]\n\nFollowing the Council of Constantinople in May\u2013June 536, Patriarch Menas of Constantinople wrote to Patriarch Peter of Jerusalem urging him to hold a council of the Three Palestines to condemn the same heretics as had Constantinople: Anthimus, Severus of Antioch, Za\u02bf\u016bra the Stylite and Peter of Apamea. The emperor also sent a letter. These letters were delivered by the monks of the Judaean Desert who had traveled to Constantinople to take part in the council there. Since Jerusalem had only been raised to a patriarchate by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the authority of the bishop of the city over the church in the Three Palestines was not accepted by anti-Chalcedonians.[2]\n\nThe council met on 19 September 536 in Jerusalem (formally Aelia Capitolina). It conducted its business in Greek.[2] Its acts are preserved in the collection known as the Collectio Sabbaitica. The verdicts of the Council of Constantinople were read into the record and the assembled clergy at Jerusalem discussed all four condemned clerics. Their own verdict, however, only explicitly condemned Anthimus.[3] It was subscribed by 47 bishops, which was almost every bishop in the Three Palestines. There is no logical sequence to the subscriptions and they were all made in Greek.[2]\n\nThe list of 47 bishops appears to be nearly complete for the Three Palestines. Among the known sees of ancient Palestine, only the bishoprics of Diospolis, Maiuma of Ascalon,  Maiuma of Gaza and Zoara were probably in existence in 536 and are unrepresented in the subscriptions.[2]\n"

        "title": "Lamb and mutton",
        "text": "\n\nLamb and mutton, collectively sheep meat (or sheepmeat) is one of the most common meats around the world, taken from the domestic sheep, Ovis aries, and generally divided into lamb, from sheep in their first year, hogget, from sheep in their second, and mutton, from older sheep. Generally, \"hogget\" and \"sheep meat\" are not used by consumers outside Norway, New Zealand, South Africa, Scotland, and Australia. Hogget has become more common in England, particularly in the North (Lancashire and Yorkshire) often in association with rare breed and organic farming.\n\nIn South Asian and Caribbean cuisine, \"mutton\" often means goat meat.[1][2][3][4][5] At various times and places, \"mutton\" or \"goat mutton\" has occasionally been used to mean goat meat.[1]\n\nLamb is the most expensive of the three types, and in recent decades, sheep meat has increasingly only been retailed as \"lamb\", sometimes stretching the accepted distinctions given above. The stronger-tasting mutton is now hard to find in many areas, despite the efforts of the Mutton Renaissance Campaign in the UK. In Australia, the term prime lamb is often used to refer to lambs raised for meat.[6] Other languages, such as French, Spanish, and Italian, make similar or even more detailed distinctions among sheep meats by age and sometimes by sex and diet\u2014for example, lechazo in Spanish refers to meat from milk-fed (unweaned) lambs.\n\nThe definitions for lamb, hogget and mutton vary considerably between countries. Younger lambs are smaller and tenderer. Mutton is meat from a sheep over two years old, and has tougher flesh. In general, the darker the colour, the older the animal.\n\nIn Romanesco dialect, the offspring of the sheep who is still suckling or recently weaned is called abbacchio, while the offspring of the sheep almost a year old who has already been shorn twice is called agnello (lit.\u2009'lamb').[15] This distinction exists only in the Romanesco dialect.[15] Abbacchio is consumed throughout central Italy as an Easter and Christmas dish.[11][12][13] It is a product protected by the European Union with the PGI mark.[14]\n\nThroughout central Italy, including Sardinia, pastoralism was the main source of meat. Since ancient times, abbacchio has been one of the staple foods of the Lazio region, especially for rural communities, whose consumption at the table was considerable.[15] The tradition of consuming abbacchio spread in ancient times where mainly adult sheep were slaughtered. The slaughter of abbacchio was forbidden except during the Easter and Christmas periods, and until June. Over the centuries, given the importance of the food, around 100 recipes for preparing lamb have been developed in Lazio.[15] Given the importance of abbacchio in social life, historical events dedicated to abbacchio are still organized in the Lazio region today, i.e. sagre, country festivals and popular events.[15] In ancient times, sheep was eaten during work in the countryside, while abbacchio was consumed only during the Easter holidays.[15]\n\nThe term \"mutton\" is applied to goat meat in most countries of South Asia, and the goat population has been rising. For example, mutton curry is always made from goat meat. It is estimated that over a third of the goat population is slaughtered every year and sold as mutton. The domestic sheep population in India and the Indian subcontinent has been in decline for over 40 years and has survived at marginal levels in mountainous regions, based on wild-sheep breeds, and mainly for wool production.[16]\n\nIn the early 1900s, mutton was widely consumed in the United States, but mutton consumption has declined since World War II.[17] As of 2010[update], most sheep meat in the United States comes from animals in between 12 and 14 months old,[18] and is called \"lamb\"; the term \"hogget\" is not used.[19] Federal statutes and regulations dealing with food labeling in the United States permit all sheep products to be marketed as \"lamb.\"[20] USDA grades for lamb are only partly a function of the animal's age. Animals up to 20 months old may meet the quality of the \"USDA prime\" grade depending on other factors, while \"USDA choice\" lamb can be of any age.[21]\n\"Spring lamb\" is defined by the USDA as having been slaughtered between March and October.[22]\n\nThe meat of a lamb is taken from the animal between one month and one year old, with a carcass weight of between 5.5 and 30\u00a0kg (12 and 66\u00a0lb). This meat generally is more tender than that from older sheep and appears more often on tables in some Western countries. Hogget and mutton have a stronger flavour than lamb because they contain a higher concentration of species-characteristic fatty acids and are preferred by some.[27] Mutton and hogget also tend to be tougher than lamb (because of connective tissue maturation) and are therefore better suited to casserole-style cooking, as in Lancashire hotpot, for example.\n\nLamb is often sorted into three kinds of meat: forequarter, loin, and hindquarter. The forequarter includes the neck, shoulder, front legs, and the ribs up to the shoulder blade. The hindquarter includes the rear legs and hip. The loin includes the ribs between the two.\n\nLamb chops are cut from the rib, loin, and shoulder areas. The rib chops include a rib bone; the loin chops include only a chine bone. Shoulder chops are usually considered inferior to loin chops; both kinds of chops are usually grilled. Breast of lamb (baby chops) can be cooked in an oven.\n\nLeg of lamb is a whole leg; saddle of lamb is the two loins with the hip. Leg and saddle are usually roasted, though the leg is sometimes boiled.\n\nForequarter meat of sheep, as of other mammals, includes more connective tissue than some other cuts, and, if not from a young lamb, is best cooked slowly using either a moist method, such as braising or stewing, or by slow roasting or American barbecuing. It is, in some countries, sold already chopped or diced.\n\nLamb shank definitions vary, but generally include:\n\nMutton barbeque is a tradition in Western Kentucky. The area was strong in the wool trade, which gave them plenty of older sheep that needed to be put to use.[28]\n\nThin strips of fatty mutton can be cut into a substitute for bacon called macon.\n\nLamb tongue is popular in Middle Eastern cuisine both as a cold cut and in preparations like stews.[29][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nApproximate zones of the usual UK cuts of lamb:[30]\n\n[32][33]\n\nAccording to the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook for 2016, the top consumers of sheep meat in 2015 were as follows:[34] EU countries are not individually surveyed in this list. Among EU nations, Greece is the per capita leader in consumption at 12.3\u00a0kg,[35] while the UK's annual per capita lamb consumption is 4.7\u00a0kg.[36] Outside of the OECD, the largest per capita consumer overall is Mongolia, with 45.1\u00a0kg.[36]\n\nThe table below gives a sample of producing nations, but many other significant producers in the 50\u2013120\u00a0kt range are not given.\n\nMeat from sheep features prominently in the cuisines of several Mediterranean cultures including Greece, Croatia, Turkey, North Africa, Jordan, and the Middle East, as well as in the cuisines of Iran and Afghanistan. In Greece, for example, it is an integral component of many meals and of religious feasts such as Easter, like avgolemono and magiritsa. It is also popular in the Basque culture, both in the Basque country of Europe and in shepherding parts of the Western United States (where shepherds of Basque descent have been active since the 1850s). In the United States, the Navajo have incorporated mutton and lamb into their traditional cuisine since the introduction of sheep by Spanish explorers and settlers in the 17th century, replacing wild turkey and venison and creating a pastoral culture. In Northern Europe, mutton and lamb feature in many traditional dishes, including those of Iceland, Norway and Western Europe, including those of the United Kingdom, particularly in the western and northern uplands, Scotland and Wales. Mutton used to be an important part of Hungarian cuisine due to strong pastoral traditions but began to be increasingly looked down on with the spread of urbanisation.[citation needed]\n\nMutton is also popular in Australia. Lamb and mutton are very popular in Central Asia and in certain parts of China, where other red meats may be eschewed for religious or economic reasons. Barbecued mutton is also a specialty in some areas of the United States (chiefly Owensboro, Kentucky) and Canada. However, meat from sheep is generally consumed far less in the US than in many European, Central American and Asian cuisines; for example, average per-capita consumption of lamb in the United States is only 400 grams (14\u00a0oz) per year.[36]\n\nIn Australia, the leg of lamb roast is considered to be the national dish.[38] Commonly served on a Sunday or any other special occasion, it can be done in a kettle BBQ or a conventional oven. Typical preparation involves covering the leg of lamb with butter, pushing rosemary sprigs into incisions cut in the leg, and sprinkling rosemary leaves on top. The lamb is then roasted for two hours at 180\u00a0\u00b0C (350\u00a0\u00b0F) and typically served with carrots and potato (also roasted), green vegetables and gravy.\n\nIn Indonesia, lamb is popularly served as lamb satay[39] and lamb curry.[40] Both dishes are cooked with various spices from the islands, and served with either rice or lontong. A version of lamb and bamboo shoot curry is the specialty of Minang cuisine, although similar dishes can be found in Thai cuisine.\n\nIn Mexico, lamb is the meat of choice for barbacoa, in which the lamb is roasted or steamed wrapped in maguey leaves underground.[41]\n\nIn Japan, although lamb is not traditionally consumed in most of the country, on the northern island of Hokkaido and in the northeastern Tohoku regions, a hot-pot dish called jingisukan (i.e. \"Genghis Khan\") is popular. In that dish, thin-sliced lamb is cooked over a convex skillet alongside various vegetables and mushrooms in front of the diners, then dipped in soy-sauce-based dipping sauces and eaten. It was so named because lamb is popular in Mongolia (see \"Sheep meat consumption\" above).\n\nLamb's liver, known as lamb's fry in New Zealand and Australia,[42] is eaten in many countries. It is the most common form of offal eaten in the UK, traditionally used in the family favourite (and pub grub staple) of liver with onions, potentially also with bacon and mashed potatoes. It is a major ingredient, along with the lungs and heart (the pluck), in the traditional Scottish dish of haggis.\n\nLamb testicles or lamb fries are a delicacy in many parts of the world.\n\nLamb kidneys are found in many cuisines across Europe and the Middle East, often split into two halves and grilled (on kebabs in the Middle East), or saut\u00e9ed in a sauce. They are generally the most highly regarded of all kidneys.\n\nLamb sweetbreads are a delicacy in many cuisines.[43]\n\nProduction of lamb emits more greenhouse gas per gram of protein than other common foods, except for beef.[45]\n"

        "text": "The Battle of the Fetters (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 (pedas); also translated as chains or shackles) was an engagement between Sparta and their neighbors to the north, Tegea. It came about when Sparta, in search of new land, sought to conquer the people of Arcadia in the central Peloponnese. The story comes from Herodotus and he gave no date for it, except to say that it occurred shortly after Lycurgus the lawgiver had re-engineered Spartan society to set it on the military footing for which it was famous throughout the Archaic and Classical periods of Greek history. His rendering is short enough to quote in full:\nWith these changes [Lycurgan reforms], they attained good government, and after Lycurgus died, they build a shrine in his honor and worshipped him with great reverence. And as their land was fertile and their population large, they soon thrived and became a flourishing people. Indeed, they were no longer content with peace, and because they assumed that they could prove themselves superior to the Arcadians, they consulted the oracle at Delphi about all the land in Arcadia.\u00a0The Pythia replied:\n\nFor Arcadia you ask me; you ask for much; I refuse to give it. Eaters of acorns, and many of them, dwell in Arcadia, and they will stop you.\u00a0But not all will I grudge you; Tegea I will give you, a dance floor to tread, a beautiful plain to measure out with a line.\n\n\nWhen these verses were reported to the Lacedaemonians, their reaction was to forgo the rest of Arcadia and march on Tegea. Overlooking the ambiguity of the oracle, they brought shackles along with them, confident that they would enslave the Tegeans. In the battle that took place, however, the Spartans were defeated, and all of them who were taken alive were made to work the plain of Tegea, measuring it out with a line and wearing the very shackles they had brought along with them. Those shackles are still, even in my day, hanging safe in Tegea, around the temple of Athena Alea.[1]\nIndeed, they were still there when travel writer Pausanias visited Tegea in the 2nd century CE.[2]\n\nThere were to be additional defeats for Sparta at the hands of the Tegeans. In frustration, they revisited the oracle at Delphi to determine what it would take to beat them and were told to bring the bones of Orestes back to Sparta.\u00a0Unable to discover their location, they went a third time to Delphi and were told they were in Tegea. The exact location was described, but in ambiguous terms, and it was a considerable time before Lichas, one of their retired soldiers, figured it out on a visit to Tegea. He was eventually able to secure the bones and return them to Sparta, at which time the Spartans were able to conquer the Tegeans. This repatriation took place, according to Herodotus, during the Spartan kingships of Anaxandridas (560-520) and Ariston (550-515), in the time when Croesus was ruler of Lydia in Anatolia (585-546) \u2013 putting it in the 550-546 time frame.[3]\n"

        "text": "When Love Digs a Hole (French: Quand l'amour se creuse un trou) is a 2018 Quebec black comedy film written and directed by Canadian director Ara Ball being his debut long feature film.[1] It was launched on 15 June 2018 on Canadian screen in both French and English.[2]\n\nThe scenario was written by Ball in 16 days while in Peru in the winter of 2017 and filmed it in locations mainly in Howick in the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie region of Quebec, Canada. Miron, the film's young character does share some superficial traits with Ball's younger days (including a hairdo) and Ball says the film is a tribute to his own grandmother Margaret Ball as he was so close to her. The film also has some reference points to Hal Ashby's film Harold and Maude that his grandmother introduced him to when Ball was just 12.[3]\n\nMiron, a young delinquent man (Robert Naylor) leads a party life in a 1990s Montreal and fails in school. His parents, David and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (Patrice Robitaille and Julie Le Breton), both university professors force their son to follow them to the countryside in the hope that the remoteness of the city's distractions will allow him to concentrate and eventually succeed in high school. Meanwhile, David and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se have marital issues of their own with the rift widening between the two as the summer days progress.\n\nAfter a week at the cottage, Miron meets Florence (France Castel), the 73-year-old neighbour. It's love at first sight between the two, with 55 years separating them. Various chores done by Miron develop eventually into a sexual relationship. And with a profound change in Miron emotional life comes also a big improvement in his home studies with the aid and supervision of his mother homeschooling him.\n\nAs the relationship between Miron and Florence deepens further, Miron's parents become very concerned with this love affair, so Miron's parents forbid their son from seeing Florence, including his father locking Miron in his room in an imposed night curfew. But determined to live his love story to the end, Miron makes every effort to see Florence again and starts digging a tunnel from his own room wall leading to Florence's home, and after many days of relentless labour, the tunnel digging is fruitful and Miron and Florence are able to meet in secret on a daily basis unbeknownst to Miron's parents whose personal rift is starting to patch up with a rekindled affinity between the two.\n\nAs the family's vacation is over and they have to return to Montreal, Miron helps his parents with their luggage and then escapes through the makeshift tunnel eloping with Florence.\n"

        "text": "\n\nOsborne Stable Block was built in 1859 on the old cricket ground in the grounds of Osborne House, the former royal residence in East Cowes, Isle of Wight, England. \nIt is a Grade II* listed building.[1][2]\n\nOsborne had been built between 1845 and 1851 for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert as a summer home and rural retreat.\nThe estate outgrew the former house stables and in 1859 Prince Albert designed the current Stable Block Quadrangle himself. The builder was Thomas Cubitt, the London architect and builder whose company built the main fa\u00e7ade of Buckingham Palace for the royal couple in 1847.\n\nThe stables were constructed to a quadrangular floor plan of rendered brick with a state roof. A central 2 storey entrance pavilion with an arched entrance is flanked on both sides by two storey (formerly one storey) wings of 8 bays. \n\nQueen Victoria died in January 1901. Following her death, Osborne house became surplus to royal requirements and was given by King Edward VII to the state with a few rooms retained as a private royal museum dedicated to Queen Victoria. In 1903, part of the estate, the Stable Block being the hub, became a junior officer training college for the Royal Navy known as the Royal Naval College, Osborne. Initial training began at the age of 13, and further studies were continued at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. The College closed in 1921, with the last students leaving on 9 April 1921.\n\nFormer students included Queen Victoria's great-grandsons, the future Edward VIII and George VI, and their younger brother George, Duke of Kent. Another well-known alumnus of the college was Jack Llewelyn Davies, one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. Davies \u2014 whose brothers all went to Eton \u2014 described his five years at Osborne as horrendous. The case of George Archer-Shee from 1908, who was expelled from Osborne after being falsely accused of stealing a 5-shilling postal order, inspired the play The Winslow Boy.\n\nIn 1927 the Red Cross voluntary aid detachment nurses from all over the United Kingdom were allowed to use the old naval college buildings for their summer training camp.  In 1934 the camps stopped as the former naval college dormitory blocks were being demolished.\n\nIn 1942 the Stable Block was commandeered by the Government for the war effort to provide a Head Office and design/drawing offices for Saunders Roe Ltd. At the end of the war the company took out a long lease with the Crown Estates. The company and its successors operated there for forty-five years.  The products that emerged from the work undertaken there included the largest aeroplane in the world in its time, the only jet-powered seaplane, the fastest aircraft of its time, the first and largest Hovercraft, development of the nation's only successful space vehicle, components for the fastest car in the world.\nDuring 1942 part of the Stable Block was bombed.\n\nFrom 1987 until 1999 the Stable Block fell into disrepair and most of the buildings became semi derelict. \n\nIn 1999 Mr & Mrs Harrison obtained a long lease from the Crown Estates and operated their storage business from one of the usable buildings. Part of their agreement with the Crown estates was to bring the Stable Block up to a good state of repair. Since 1999 the Stable Block and surrounding buildings have been transformed into a small business park.  The Stable Block and quadrangle have been greatly restored and it is hoped will continue to make history during this century.\n\n50\u00b044\u203257\u2033N 1\u00b016\u203229\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff50.749223\u00b0N 1.274593\u00b0W\ufeff / 50.749223; -1.274593\n"

It is known as the \"World of Formation\".\n\n\"Yetzirah\" as in \"formation\" is as opposed to \"Beriah\" as in \"creation\": actually taking whatever matter that was created in \"Beriah\" and shaping it into the basic elements.\n\nOn the Tree of Life diagram Yetzirah is associated with the sefirot Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod and Yesod. Together, these six sefirot are known as the Microprosopus (Zeir Anpin) also known as the 'Lesser Countenance' or the 'Small Face.'  In this sense, it stands in contrast with the Macroprosopus (Arich Anpin).\n\nThe moment of formation, when the fetus' form becomes apparent, is called \"the formation of the child\" and corresponds to the world of Yetzirah.[1] The external state of consciousness in the World of Formation is called \u05f4half good and half evil.\u05f4 The \"half evil\" refers to the self-consciousness of the beings of this world. The \"half good\" refers to the emotional sensitivity of one to the other as expressed in the genuine desire to make the other happy.

But in order for our good inclination to be victorious over our evil inclination, it must first be empowered by an input of Divine light and energy. God gives us this input in the merit of our first devoting ourselves to do good for our fellows.[2]\n\nThe consciousness of the world of Yetzirah is that of communing with God, speaking to Him directly in prayer or indirectly through the study of His Torah and taking counsel with a true Torah sage.[3] The perspective of the world of Yetzirah as a state of consciousness is based on general notions. At this level, particular definitions are not apparent. The sense of selfhood that is apparent at this level of consciousness can only be grasped in impersonal language.[4]\n\nNon-permanent angels dwell in the world of Yetzirah, unlike archangels which reside in Briah.\n\nIn addition, Yetzirah corresponds to:\n"

He was invested as a Knight of the Golden Fleece in 1763 and also became Gran Cruz de la Orden de Carlos III in the same year. He held many other Dukedoms, Marquees, Counties, and lesser titles. He died in Madrid on 4 December 1773, aged 57.\n\nHe married firstly Teresa, daughter of the 10th Duke of Medina Sidonia in September 1735, (one daughter); and secondly married Maria Antonia Gonzaga Caracciolo, daughter of the Duke of Solferino, (two females and two males)\n\nJo\u00e9 Mar\u00eda (Madrid, 16 July 1756 \u2013 Sevilla 9 June 1798), the first male son of the 2nd marriage of the 8th Duke, inherited the title. By the time of his death in 1798, he was holder of six Grandees of Spain, four Dukedoms (the Medina Sidonia Duchy from a childless cousin, a Perez de Guzm\u00e1n y Pacheco, and the Duchy of Alba through marriage to the famed Cayetana de Alba, one of the widowed aristocrat women friends of Court Painter Francisco de Goya), two Principalities, eight Marquisates, eight Countships, two Baronetcies, and many other lesser titles, (Spanish and Italian). Together with the Dukes of Osuna, the Tellez-Gir\u00f3n family, he became one of the biggest private land owners in Andalusia.\n\n\"Cayetana\", (1762\u20131802), 13th Duchess of Alba, 11th Duchess Consort of Bivona, granddaughter of the President of the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola de la Lengua: We believe it is worth to explore, something obvious but curiously lacking till now about the intellectual background surrounding the ignored 11th Duke of Bivona and his wife, frequently named, (wrongly), as Cayetana de Silva, 13th Duchess of Alba on her own rights.\n\nChiefly, they seem to have been much abused later by their supposed \"populist\" background in the late romantic, bullfighting loving, popular and oversexed Spain derived from the Napoleonic invasions, the rather rough following up Borbon Kings and Queens of Spain, and the rising of the so-called liberal and conservative political options of bourgeois Roman Catholic 19th-century Spain.\n\nThe 9th Duke of Bivona, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, married on 15 January 1775, being a descendant from a cadet branch named \"Alvarez de Toledo\" himself, related to the Dukes of Alba in the 16th century, and on the verge of such family name disappearing since 1728 altogether from the Alba nobility registers. A woman, very well known even today as \"Cayetana\", her real name being Cayetana de Silva y Silva \u2013 Baz\u00e1n, who descended through her female side grandmother, of Maria Teresa Alvarez de Toledo y de Haro, 11th Duchess of Alba, (? \u2013 married 1714 Count Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Silva \u2013 Duchess of Alba by succession in 1739\u20131755).\n\nThere was the possibility that if Jose Maria and Cayetana got any male children that the \"Alvarez de Toledo\" name could came back again to be used both, the Marquis of villafranca del Bierzo (and Duke of Bivona and many other titles) Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda and also to the Dukes of Alba (with many pother titles), in other words, as it was in the 16th century.\n\nThis grandmother of Cayetana, who arrived to be 11th Duchess of Alba, was the mother, between others, of the 12th Duke of Alba, now named, as his father (the 10th Count of Galve), Fernando de Silva y Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Hu\u00e9scar, between other titles during his childhood, his mother being nevertheless the 11th Duchess till her death in 1755.\n\nThis 12th Duke of Alba since 1755, Don Fernando, i.e., Fernando de Silva y Alvarez de Toledo, (1714 \u2013 15 November 1776), would be the father of the 13th Duke of Alba, Francisco de Paula de Silva, the later being the father in law, through \"Cayetana\", of the 11th Duke of Bivona, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda.\n\nFernando, 9th Duke of Huescar who became 12th Duke of Alba after 1755, besides being grandfather of the famous \"Cayetana\" was Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1746, Ambassador in France (1746\u20131749). He was also a Director of the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola de la Lengua for 22 years, from 9 April 1754 till his death in November 1776.\n\nThe Duke Academician Fernando was also 5th Conde-Duque de Olivares and Duque de Sanl\u00facar-la-Mayor, Grandee of Spain, 10th Marqu\u00e9s del Carpio, 10th Conde de Monterrey, 13th Conde de Ler\u00edn, Condestable de Navarra, 11th Conde de Galve, 14th Conde de Alba de Tormes, 17th Se\u00f1or de Valdecorneja, etc.\n\nHe had married Ana Mar\u00eda Alvarez de Toledo y de Portugal, (1710\u20131738), 9th Duchess Consort of Hu\u00e9scar, Grandee of Spain, daughter of the 9th Conde de Oropesa.\n\nThey were the parents of:\n\nFrancisco de Paula de Silva y Alvarez de Toledo, (1733\u20131770), 10th Duque de Hu\u00e9scar (1755), Conde de Siruela, who married Maria del Pilar Ana de Silva- Baz\u00e1n y Sarmiento (n. 1740 \u2013 m. 1784), 10th Duchess Consort de Hu\u00e9scar, daughter of Pedro Artal de Silva Baz\u00e1n, 8th Marqu\u00e9s de Santa-Cruz.\n\nMar\u00eda del Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva-Alvarez de Toledo y Silva Baz\u00e1n, ( 1762 \u2013 married 1775, aged 13 \u2013 1802) m. 1802, Duquesa de Montoro, 13th Duchess de Alba de Tormes, G.E.

Therefore, the 11th Duke of Bivona, 14th Count of Niebla, and many family connected titles was, apparently, the young teenager Duke, Pedro de Alcantara younger sibling:\n\nFrancisco Alvarez de Toledo y Palafox (Madrid, 9 June 1799 \u2013 Madrid, 31 January 1816, aged 16 only).\n\nIt seems that, for some reason, the eldest brother, Pedro de Alc\u00e1ntara, inherited a part of the titles with the 15th-century title of Dukedom of Medina Sidonia, while another part went to the unfortunate younger brother Francisco, in spite that their father died in 1821.\n\nThe outcome was then a succession; the 14th Duke of Bivona, and annexed titles, passed to the third male alive in the family Alvarez de Toledo-Palafox.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alvarez de Toledo y Palafox, described as \"Giuseppe\" by Italian genealogists, Grandee of Spain, (C\u00e1diz, Spain, 1 February 1812 \u2013 married in Paris, France, 22 June 1837, aged 25, 20 years old Mar\u00eda del Carmen Luc\u00eda de Acu\u00f1a y Dewitte, (Paris 22 June 1817,(\u00bf?) \u2013 Naples, Italy, 15 January 1888, aged 71) \u2013 Naples, Italy, 7 January 1885, aged 72).\n\nParis 1838 and Madrid 1898: Marrying within the new Spanish military structures and into wealth: Then, the 15th Duke of Bivona would be Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Acu\u00f1a, (Paris, France, 6 August 1838 \u2013 married in San Sebastian, Spain, on 21 August 1864, aged 26, the 16-year-old only lady thereto described as \"Jacinta\" \u2013 Madrid, 31 August 1898, aged 60).\n\nSixteen-year-old \"Do\u00f1a Jacinta\", the 13th Duchess Consort, was the daughter of a most significant General Governor of the Spanish Island of Cuba, Jos\u00e9 Gutierrez de la Concha e Irigoyen, (Cordoba, Argentina, 1809\u20131895) and also the uterine sister of another \"Do\u00f1a Jacinta\", the wife of one of the more significant \"Military and Politician\" Generals of 19th-century Spain, Baldomero Espartero, (27 February 1793 \u2013 8 January 1879).\n"

        "text": "\n\nThe African brown water snake (Afronatrix anoscopus) is a species of non-venomous semiaquatic oviparous snake in the subfamily Natricinae of the family Colubridae.[2] The species, which is monotypic in the genus Afronatrix, is native to West Africa. It is commonly found in many West African countries in freshwater swamps, rivers, streams, ponds, and sometimes brackish bodies of water.[3] This species can grow up to 75 cm, and It preys on other aquatic animals like fish, frogs, tadpoles, and frog eggs.[4]\n\nHas a patchy distribution across West Africa, with confirmed records in Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Cameroon. [5]It is likely present in other West African countries, but limited survey reports have resulted in a lack of records from these areas. It was reported in 2011 that the African brown water snake is the most abundant snake species in the rainforests of southeastern Guinea. The high population density of this species in many West African streams, along with dietary evidence, indicates that this snake plays a key role as a primary fish predator in these ecosystems.[6]\n\nA. anoscopus eats fish and amphibians. Studies in Nigeria show that it feeds on frogs, including Silurana tropicalis, Ptychadena spp., and Bufomaculatus, as well as fish like cyprinids and mudskippers. Juveniles eat more tadpoles, while adults consume more fish. This change in diet as the snake grows is similar to patterns seen in some European Natricinae like the grass snake. It hunts in freshwater swamps, rivers, and streams, and sometimes in brackish water.[4]\n\nA. anoscopus can grow up to 75 cm. (29.5 in.).[4] Its most common color is solid brown to reddish with fewer specimens being yellow-brown with black ocular spots. Typical tail length for this snake is 42\u00a0cm (17\u00a0in), but there have been reports of lengths reaching 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in). Typical snout-vent length is 14.6\u201345.5\u00a0cm (5.7\u201317.9\u00a0in).[7] Males and females do not have significant differences in average total length.[7]\n\nThe Afronatrix genus, which includes A. anoscopus, is considered unique when compared to other members of the natricine subfamily in that it has lateral keels on its subcaudals. Additionally, it exhibits subocular scales, and will have a minimum of 21 dorsal scale rows. Its hemipenis anatomy has strong similarity to some Asian natricine snakes in that it is only partially bilobed and asymmetrical. This along with biochemical data suggests a close relationship between the two species.[8] Its dentition is described as syncranterian (firmly fused to the jawbone without sockets).[9]\n\nPrimarily inhabits ponds and freshwater rivers in rainforest zones of West Africa. Its habitat use changes with the seasons, likely in response to water availability. During the wet season, when ponds are full, the species is commonly found in these temporary water bodies. However, as ponds dry out in the dry season, many individuals move to freshwater rivers, where water remains available. This seasonal migration helps the snakes access stable food resources, such as fish and frogs, which are abundant in flooded habitats but scarcer in dried out areas.[3]\n"

TKC is one of the best all-girls[1] residential school (Sekolah Berasrama Penuh) and the first fully residential girls' school in Malaysia. In 2010, the school was awarded with the Sekolah Berprestasi Tinggi or High Performance School[2] title, a title awarded to the 20 schools in Malaysia that have met stringent criteria including academic achievement, strength of alumni, international recognition, network, and linkages. The school is specialised in leadership, innovation, and invention.[3]\n\nIn the 2013 PMR examination, the school managed to produce 96 out of 112 (85.7%) of straight A students with GPS 1.03 to the best school in Negeri Sembilan[4] while for Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM), the school's GPS was 1.5.[5]\n\nTunku Kurshiah College was established as Malay Girls College in 1947.[6] It was initially located at a piece of land located at the 2 1/2 Mile of Jalan Damansara, Kuala Lumpur. It was officially opened by Lady Gent, the wife of Sir Edward Gent, the Governor of Malayan Union. The place is now known as Bukit Damansara.\n\nIn April 1962, the college moved to a 25 acres (100,000\u00a0m2) site at Bukit Merbah, Jalan Tunku Kurshiah, Seremban. The college changed its name to Tunku Kurshiah College, in honour of the first Raja Permaisuri Agong. It was formalised when the college was declared open by Almarhum Tuanku Munawir ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, the then Yang Di Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan on 24 May 1963.\n\nIn 1986, the school were chosen as one of 20 pilot school for Computer Literacy Pilot Project and received Apple II.[7]\n\nIn 2000, TKC was chosen as one of the schools to participate in the Malaysia Smart Schools flagship application of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).[8] The school is the first batch of Cluster Schools which granted itself autonomy to select its own students in 2007.[9] The school niche area is student leadership, English proficiency, and research and development (R & D).[10] Three years later, in 2010, the school again was selected to be among the first High Performing Schools (Sekolah Berprestasi Tinggi)[11] with niche at leadership, innovation and invention.[12]\n\nIn 2011, the school band was featured in a flashmob style, reality programme, Refleksi Orkestra in conjunction with Orkestra RTM 50 Golden Jubilee.[13]\n\nThe school moved to its new premise in Bandar Enstek, Nilai in January 2013.[14] TKC new campus has two main blocks, namely academic lower secondary and upper secondary, an administrator block which consists of an office, teachers' chambers, libraries, laboratories, and a main hall which can accommodate 1,000 people. The main academic block can accommodate as many as 650 Ministry's stream students and 100 International Baccalaureate students. The university-style campus also has dormitory blocks, a surau, warden's residence, cafeteria, convenient sports fields and arenas, as well as WiFi.[15] The campus has an area as large as 17.4 hectares, built with cost approximately RM 75 million.[16] The process of moving to new premises was documented by TV3 (Malaysia) documentary programme Majalah Tiga.[17]\n\nTKC basketball team is known as TKC KUDOS and TKC hockey team is known as TKC Vitesse. In addition, TKC touch rugby team is known TKC La Reine while TKC Wind Orchestra is popularly known as TKWO.\n\nTKC has a long-held rivalry with other all-girls premier boarding schools, notably being Sekolah Tun Fatimah and Sekolah Seri Puteri.\n\nThe alumni association of TKC is known as TKC Old Girls Association (TKC OGA). The association was set up in 1961, before the college was moved from Damansara to Seremban, and was officially registered on 18 January 1962. The setting up of the association came from the initiative of E. M. Pereira, the college principal then, and Puan Abbasiah Amirin Wiloughby, the first head girl of the college.\n\nThe new TKC OGA building is located in the Diplomatic Precinct Town Centre, which is sandwiched between Precinct 14 and 15 of the new administration centre of Putrajaya.  The particular site of the new MGC/TKC OGA building is under the first phase of the commercial centre of the project, comprising two-storey to four-storey properties.\n\n\n"

        "title": "Local Mitigation Strategy",
        "text": "A Local Mitigation Strategy (LMS) or Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) is a local government plan (in the United States, typically implemented at a county level), that is designed to reduce or eliminate risks to people and property from natural and man-made hazards. Mitigation strategies are supported by state government and federal programs, in line with the Disaster Mitigation Act.\n\nThe need for hazard mitigation has become more widely recognized over the past few years, due to the large number of natural hazards that have occurred in the U.S. and the increase in the costs to achieve post-disaster recovery.  Money spent prior to a hazardous event to reduce the impacts of a disaster can result in substantial savings in life and property following the event.  The benefits of implementing a hazard mitigation program usually far outweigh the costs.  As a result, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the states have developed national and state Mitigation Strategies and funding is becoming increasingly more available to support hazard mitigation efforts.\n\nThe advantages of developing a LMS include access to government funds for hazard mitigation projects, the provision of protective information to local officials, residents, and businesses, and the protection of an area's population, property, infrastructure, economy, environment, and quality of life.\n\nThe hazard mitigation initiatives that a community develops must have their basis in the community's guiding principles on hazard mitigation, and should also be grounded in an empirical, geographic, and historical analysis of the jurisdiction's hazards. The initiatives must actively reduce a community's vulnerability to hazards in order to be considered mitigation activities, rather than emergency preparedness activities. Actions and their implementation expenses can be justified through the vulnerability assessment section of the strategy, which documents the types of damages and other impacts that hazards have had, or could cause in the future, within the planning area. Finally, mitigation initiatives must accurately reflect the community's needs\u2014what is politically, legally, economically, and technically feasible and sufficiently equitable in socioeconomic terms.  The working group assigned to develop the strategy can help assure that local needs are incorporated in the mitigation initiatives. These steps should lead to projects that are grounded in a community's overall vision of hazard mitigation, planning, regulations, resources, and goals, and that can lead to a tangible reduction in its vulnerability to hazards, based upon the findings of its hazard analysis section.\n"

        "title": "Salon Natasha",
        "text": "Salon Natasha was Vietnam\u2019s first private contemporary art space established in 1990 by the late artist V\u0169 D\u00e2n T\u00e2n (1946\u20132009) and his Russian wife Natalia (Natasha) Kraevskaia.[1] Situated in their home and Vu Dan Tan\u2019s studio at 30 Hang Bong, Hanoi, it functioned outside of the legal framework and was free from any official interference.[2]\u00a0It was the first venue in Hanoi to exhibit young, experimental and non-commercial artists, as well as a meeting spot for creative people and intellectuals. Proclaiming its main goal as freedom of expression, during its almost two decades of activities, Salon Natasha has organized around one hundred artistic events extending from curated exhibitions to creative collaborations, spontaneous performances and international exchanges. Many of the country\u2019s leading contemporary artists started their career at Salon Natasha.\n\nWhile the Vietnamese art scene was often monitored by the centralized government, in terms of both activities and art forms, Salon Natasha provided an autonomous space and played a major role in liberating artistic production.\n\nIn 2005, Salon Natasha terminated its exhibition activities, Vu Dan Tan once again turned the space into his art studio but kept its doors open to the public. After his death in 2009 it was transformed into a commemorative space which existed until 2017.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Vu Dan Tan lived in the Soviet Union, where he witnessed the dramatic shift in visual art after Perestroika. This inspired him to seek change in his own country. During that time, \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi, a policy of renovation similar to the processes happening in Russia, contrarily to the cultural shifts that he observed in Russia, did not bring any significant change to the Vietnamese art scene. Vu Dan Tan decided to establish a new public space, located right in his home. It could provide new opportunities for innovation and serve as a place where like-minded people, committed to art, could gather. He decided to name it \u2018Salon\u2019 in the French-Russian sense, implying that its goal would be not just to organize exhibitions, but also to host various cultural events and to encourage artist-audience dialogues.\n\nAs a platform for the exchange of ideas, Salon Natasha thus continued the tradition that began in Tan\u2019s studio which had been known as a gathering place for Hanoi bohemian circles and intelligentsia since the late 1970s.[3]\n\nSalon Natasha was a space where artists felt free to experiment with art making practices without the pressure of having to consent either with the market or the State\u2019s guidelines. Moreover, it never had the look of a \"white cube\" gallery, quite the contrary, it combined the aesthetics of its original use \u2013 a living space with an artist studio and exhibition capacities.[4] Salon Natasha was a living organism that could adapt to the needs of artists that utilized the space for their projects and to engage public in a creative atmosphere. All activities carried out by Salon Natasha were self-supported and were never sponsored by outside entities.\n\nContrary to the art works in government-run spaces and official exhibitions which, in the 1990s, still featured typical socialist realist topics, and as compared to the art of commercial galleries, the art shown at Salon Natasha was radically different. Topics ran from classical subjects to the ones that were taboo in the official setting, such as those related to social contradictions and social critique, community values, inner psychological issues, sexuality,[5] and personal religious expressions, among others.[6]\n\nIn addition to paintings and drawings, Salon Natasha also introduced art objects, installation, experimental photography, cross-disciplinary interactive events, and performance, forms which had just begun to penetrate the Vietnamese artistic landscape in the early 1990s.\n\nAt the time when exhibitions in Hanoi were generally labeled according to artists\u2019 selected mediums, or according to the number of participating artists, but not by theme, Salon Natasha introduced a different approach whereby exhibitions were based on specific ideas or concepts. The first group exhibition in Salon Natasha was titled Red and Yellow.[7] Other group shows, to name a few, were titled Music,[8] Composition: Movement and Immobility, and Icon of Our Time.\n\nSalon Natasha also initiated many collaborative ventures that resulted in exhibitions, public events and lasting relationships between artists. These include strong bonds that were forged among the artists of Salon while they were working together at the B\u00e1t Tr\u00e0ng ceramic village, or while producing art clocks in the Salon for the exhibition 12 O\u2019Clock, or jointly creating works on fabric banners, and co-producing a painting performance on stage during a music concert.\n\nMost of the exhibitions were conceptualized and organized (until the late 1990s the word \u201ccurate\u201d was still unknown in Vietnam) by Natasha and French artist Eric Leroux. Leroux lived in Hanoi from 1991 to 1998, and was part of the Salon Natasha artist community. Artists also organized and conceived several exhibitions themselves, such as Medium \u2013 Lacquer; Size \u2013 Small (concept and management by Bui Huu Hung, 1996) and 12 O\u2019Clock (concept and curatorial execution by Nguyen Van Cuong, 1997).\n\nStarting in the early 1990s, some international artists based in Hanoi participated in Salon Natasha exhibitions and projects on a regular basis. Aside from\u00a0 Eric Leroux (France) this included Maritta Nurmi (Finland), Bradford Edwards (USA), and Brian Ring (Canada). Starting in the mid-1990s, Salon encouraged larger scale collaborations. In 1997, the exhibition Looking in focused on works by international artists influenced by Vietnam and its culture.\n\nIn 1996, Salon Natasha initiated a long-term Vietnam-Australia mail art collaborative project called Crosscurrents, curated by Natalia Kraevskaia and Bonney Bombach (Australia) which included six Salon artists and four Australian artists. This project can be considered one of Salon Natasha\u2019s most critical initiatives as it empowered the expansion of a cross-cultural discourse between Vietnamese and international artists. After it was completed in Vietnam, it received an Australian grant that allowed it to tour in ten venues in Australia over two years.[9][10]\n\nProjects such as Crosscurrents enabled Salon Natasha to spread its art activities wider than its own physical space and realize or join exhibitions and events, both in Vietnam and abroad. The events organized by Salon Natasha in Hanoi included the exhibition Composition: Movement and Immobility at the French Cultural Centre (1995) among others.\n\nAbroad, Salon organized the project Spirit of Hanoi (or Salon Natasha as an installation) in Finland (curator Maritta Nurmi) and was present at the 12th Asian International Art Exhibition, Macao, 1997, and the 1999 exhibition Gap Viet Nam at the House of the World Cultures in Berlin. Salon Natasha was also involved in numerous charity projects.[11]\n\nFrom its early years Salon included educational elements in its activity. Vu Dan Tan conducted regular workshops with local children. Many of the Salon\u2019s conceptually-shaped projects contained an educational segment: lectures, conferences and round-tables at spaces provided by other institutions.\n\nSalon Natasha\u2019s activity has been archived by Asia Art Archive in cooperation with the co-founder and curator of Salon Natasha, Natalia Kraevskaia, and under the supervision of an official advisor to the project, Dr. Nora Taylor.[12]\n\nThe original version of the Salon Natasha archive contains 8 300 documents; 4 992 of them are displayed online. The documents encompass the years before the opening of Salon Natasha (1980s), the main period of its exhibition activities (1990-2005), its collections, social connections and media coverage. The Salon Natasha archive contains exhibition invitations and catalogues, artists\u2019 CVs and statements, project concept descriptions and correspondence between curators and artists, press and media reviews as well as digitalized images of actual artworks exhibited or collected by Salon Natasha, photographs of exhibition openings or project progress development, snapshots of the physical space of Salon Natasha and its artists and friends. The materials are accompanied by detailed metadata which helps to create links between the records and provides historical contextualization.\n\nThe Salon Natasha Archive not only features an alternative art space in Vietnam, it also traces the different pathways to contemporary art undertaken by Vietnamese artists since the onset of Doi Moi. While Salon Natasha may have had its unique qualities and innovative spirit, it is also a reflection of the artistic environment in Hanoi both before and after Doi Moi.[13]\n\n\n"

The film stars Ashwini and a newcomer Balachandran. It was released on 25 December 1983,[1] and failed at the box office.[2]\n\nThe pannaiyar of a small village is highly respected due to his generosity and kindness. His wife is equally well-liked and the loving couple have a son, Jeeva. The pannaiyar's right-hand man is Azhagiri, a man who's feared throughout the town as he's prone to violence. However, he will only resort to violence when he feels an injustice or wrong warrants his intervention. Azhagiri's sister, Devanai, is a young widow with a daughter, Selvi. The pannaiyar and his wife financially support Devanai's family. Selvi and Jeeva go to school together and are friends from childhood. As they grow older, their friendship grows into love. They go away to attend the same college. While they're away, long brewing secrets between the two families come to light and drastically change both families' circumstances. Jeeva and Selvi return home to a much-altered situation and face new challenges to their love that they must overcome.\n\nSoundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.[3][4] A section of the song \"Oru Kili Uruguthu\" was incorporated into the official trailer for The Lovebirds (2020).[5] The song also features in Miracle, a segment of the anthology film Putham Pudhu Kaalai (2020).[6] The same song was reused by Ilaiyaraaja as \"Jilibili\" for the Telugu film Sitaara (1984).[7] A snippet of the song \"Oh Vennilave\" was reused by the rapper M.I.A. in her 2022 song \"Energy Freq\".[8]\n\nJayamanmadhan of Kalki praised the cinematography and music but felt the situations were not perfect enough to befit these two and panned the acting of debut actors.[9]\n"
